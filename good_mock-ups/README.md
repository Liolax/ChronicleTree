# ChronicleTree: Your Family's Living Legacy

ChronicleTree is an innovative and robust web application for comprehensive family tree creation, management, and secure storage. It aims to empower individuals to thoroughly explore, preserve, and share their personal heritageâ€”the unique stories, connections, and genealogical data that define a family's history.

## Project Overview

The fundamental problem ChronicleTree addresses is the absence of a truly modern, intuitive, and personalized platform for genealogical record-keeping. Existing tools frequently miss opportunities for rich data capture and dynamic visualization. ChronicleTree is designed to fill this gap by blending solid data management with an engaging, interactive user experience that profoundly centers on individual family member stories.

### Core Features
*   **Comprehensive Family Tree Management:** Full CRUD functionality for creating and managing family members and their relationships.
*   **Rich, Customizable Profiles:** Go beyond names and dates with detailed questionnaires, life events, notes, and media uploads for each individual.
*   **Dynamic Tree Visualization:** An interactive and intuitive tree view that can be dynamically re-centered on any selected individual, making navigation of large trees seamless.
*   **Social Media Sharing:** Easily share visual representations of the family tree or individual profile facts on social media platforms.

## Technical Approach

ChronicleTree is built using a modern, full-stack web architecture with a focus on security, performance, and scalability.

### Technology Stack
*   **Backend:** Ruby on Rails (API-only)
*   **Frontend:** React / JavaScript (Single-Page Application)
*   **Database:** PostgreSQL
*   **Version Control:** Git / GitHub

### Architecture
The application follows a classic client-server model:
1.  **React Frontend:** A component-based SPA that provides a rich, interactive user interface. It communicates with the backend via a RESTful API.
2.  **Ruby on Rails Backend:** A robust API server that handles business logic, data persistence, and user authentication.
3.  **PostgreSQL Database:** A powerful relational database for storing the structured genealogical data.
