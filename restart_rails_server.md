# Rails Server Restart Instructions

The Redis timeout issue occurs because the Redis disabling configuration changes require a Rails server restart to take effect.

## Steps to Fix Redis Timeout Issue:

1. **Stop the current Rails server** (if running):
   - Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where the Rails server is running

2. **Navigate to the API directory**:
   ```bash
   cd chronicle_tree_api
   ```

3. **Start the Rails server again**:
   ```bash
   bundle exec rails server -p 4000
   ```

4. **Verify Redis is disabled**:
   Look for this message in the server startup output:
   ```
   Background jobs and Redis disabled for development environment
   ```

5. **Test media creation**:
   - Try creating media again in the frontend
   - The Redis timeout error should be resolved

## What the Configuration Does:

- Completely disables Redis connections in development
- Forces all background jobs to run inline (immediately)
- Prevents ActiveStorage from using background jobs for image processing
- Stubs Redis and Sidekiq classes to throw descriptive errors if accessed

## If Issue Persists:

The media creation should now work without Redis timeouts. The configuration ensures no background jobs attempt to connect to Redis during development.
