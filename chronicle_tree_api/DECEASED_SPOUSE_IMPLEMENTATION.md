# Deceased Spouse Relationship Logic Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented enhanced logic for handling deceased spouse relationships in family tree profiles to better reflect real-world relationship dynamics after death.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Backend Model Updates (`app/models/person.rb`)

#### New Methods Added:
- `deceased_spouses` - Returns spouses who have died (non-ex spouses with `date_of_death` present)
- `is_deceased?` - Helper method to check if person is deceased
- `all_spouses_including_deceased` - Returns all non-ex spouses (both living and deceased)

#### Updated In-Law Methods:
- `parents_in_law` - Returns empty array `[]` if person is deceased
- `children_in_law` - Returns empty array `[]` if person is deceased  
- `siblings_in_law` - Returns empty array `[]` if person is deceased

**Logic**: Deceased people no longer show active in-law relationships. Only living people maintain in-law connections.

### 2. Frontend Data Updates (`app/serializers/api/v1/person_serializer.rb`)

#### Enhanced Relatives Serialization:
- Added `is_deceased` field to indicate if relative is deceased
- Added `date_of_death` field for death date information
- This enables frontend to display proper status indicators like "Jane Doe (deceased in 2022)"

### 3. Relationship Scenarios Handled

#### Scenario 1: Living Person with Deceased Spouse (No Remarriage)
- **Example**: Robert was married to Molly (died 2020), never remarried
- **Result**: Robert shows NO in-laws, Molly shows NO in-laws
- **Display**: Robert sees "Molly Doe (deceased in 2020)" as spouse

#### Scenario 2: Living Person with Deceased Spouse (Remarried)  
- **Example**: John was married to Jane (died 2022), now married to Lisa
- **Result**: John shows Lisa's parents as in-laws, Jane shows NO in-laws
- **Display**: John sees "Jane Doe (deceased in 2022)" and "Lisa Doe" as spouses

#### Scenario 3: Deceased Person Profile
- **Example**: Jane Doe (died 2022) was married to John
- **Result**: Jane shows NO in-laws
- **Display**: Jane sees "John Doe (widowed in 2022)" as spouse

## Frontend Display Logic

The enhanced serialization enables the frontend to show:
- `"Jane Doe (deceased in 2022)"` - for deceased spouses
- `"John Doe (widowed in 2022)"` - for surviving spouses on deceased person's profile
- Clear visual distinction between current, ex, and deceased relationships

## Test Data

The implementation is validated using existing seed data:
- John + Jane (deceased) + Lisa (current) - remarried scenario  
- Robert + Molly (deceased) - widowed scenario
- Sarah + Thomas (deceased) - widowed scenario

## Benefits

1. **Realistic Relationship Logic**: Deceased people don't maintain active in-law relationships
2. **Clear Status Display**: Frontend can show appropriate relationship status
3. **Historical Accuracy**: Preserves relationship history while reflecting current reality
4. **User Experience**: Eliminates confusion about active vs historical relationships

## Implementation Notes

- All changes are backward compatible
- Existing relationship data structure unchanged
- Only query logic and display logic enhanced
- Debug logging maintained for troubleshooting
