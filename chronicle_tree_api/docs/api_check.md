# API Sanity Check & Review

This document outlines a review of the ChronicleTree Rails API, focusing on correctness, security, and best practices.

## 1. Controller Inheritance & Authentication

- **Status**: ✅ **Correct**
- **Details**: The controller inheritance chain is correct. `ApplicationController` includes Devise helpers, and all API controllers inherit this functionality properly.

## 2. Devise & JWT Configuration

- **Status**: ✅ **Correct**
- **Details**: The `devise_for` routes are correctly configured, and the JWT denylist strategy is fully implemented.

## 3. Authorization & Scoping

- **Status**: ✅ **Correct**
- **Details**: All controllers appear to scope data access to the `current_user` correctly.

## 4. File Organization & Cleanup

- **Status**: ✅ **Corrected**
- **Details**: Moved `api_check.md` and `api_endpoints_overview.md` into the `docs/` directory to centralize documentation. The `RelationshipsController` is correctly located at `app/controllers/api/v1/relationships_controller.rb` and is properly loaded by the router.

## Conclusion

The API's foundational structure for authentication and authorization is sound. The next phase of development should follow the [Development Roadmap](./development_roadmap.md), which outlines the plan for implementing feature-specific endpoints, tests, and database models.
