puts "  - Half-siblings display as 'Half-Brother'/'Half-Sister'"

puts "  - Works bidirectionally (Aliceâ†’Michael = Half-Brother, Michaelâ†’Alice = Half-Sister)"

puts "  - Half-sibling detection prevents incorrect step-sibling classification"

puts "  - All relationship types display correctly in generated profiles"

puts "\nâœ… Database Consistency:"
puts "  - Sibling relationships exist for all combinations"
