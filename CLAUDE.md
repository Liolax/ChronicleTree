1. replace standard alert() with SweetAlert2, remove all emoji usage, messages student-friendly and professional (not AI-like) everywhere at the project. 
2. not AI-like. i want student project-like, i want nobody know that i use ai.
3. Centralize all alerts in validationAlerts.js with sweetallert, not standart allerts.

PS. Please, if you create tests, move them to frontend_tests and backend_tests so we have only one folder for each type. Upgrade the organization of these folders every time after you test the app. Our permanent goal is to keep the app well organized. All tests must also be emoji-free, with clear, student-friendly messages and no AI-like style.
