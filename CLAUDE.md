## Issue Resolved: Lisa → Emily Step-Relationship Bug

### Problem
When Lisa (ID: 12) was set as root, Emily (ID: 6) showed as "Unrelated" instead of "Step-Granddaughter", while the relationship worked correctly when Emily was root.

### Root Cause
Timeline validation in `findStepRelationship` was overly broad and incorrectly blocking valid step-relationships. Specifically:
- Thomas Anderson (ID: 11, deceased 2018-05-14) was blocking the Lisa → Emily relationship
- Emily was born 2019-01-01 (after Thomas died)
- The algorithm incorrectly considered Thomas a "connecting person" in the Lisa → Emily path
- This blocked the valid step-relationship: Lisa → John → Alice → Emily

### Solution
Fixed timeline validation logic in `improvedRelationshipCalculator.js`:
- Made timeline validation more specific to only block deceased people actually in the relationship path
- For Lisa(12) → Emily(6), only John(1) should be able to block the relationship if deceased
- Thomas Anderson(11) is not in the step-relationship path and should not block it

### Result
✅ Emily now correctly shows as Lisa's "Step-Granddaughter" when Lisa is root
✅ Relationship works bidirectionally as expected
✅ Timeline validation still works but is no longer overly restrictive
