i still have issues. fix please.

1. use final-report-template.md. please check all chronicle-tree-final-report.md to have Actual Project Data - Incorporated our real implementation details, testing results, and achievements. compare with the original frontend and backend, and update the final report with our real data. make sure to have all our real data in the final report, not AI-generated or fake data. be descriptive and specific about our implementation, testing, and achievements. don't use emoji. try to not use many bullets. we need Professional Evaluation - Performance metrics, user testing results, and scalability analysis. as you can see, we have a lot of data in the final report, but it is not specific to our project. it is AI-generated and not real. we need to have our real data in the final report. so, please, check all chronicle-tree-final-report.md and update it with our real data. we have also useful data in refined_project_spec.md. we have started from PROPOSAL.md, then REQUIREMENTS.md, then INTERNIM.md, then refined_project_spec.md.
2. please make Executive Summary more interesting. follow the template, but make it engaging and specific to our project. examples:
   - BeerPort is a web application that is specifically designed to promote the craft
beer industry and assist small breweries in attracting more clients. The craft beer
industry has expanded significantly over the last 10 years (The Irish Food Board, 2020). While the rise of the craft beer market has been increasing, access to the
greater ranges of beer product is still limited, especially in smaller towns or
villages. The solution for this is BeerPort. The aim of BeerPort is to create a platform that allows local breweries to promote
their products and make them available for a broader range of customers
interested in beer tasting. The website will educate users on the sensory
characteristics of primary beer styles and allow users to search for a beer of the
particular style in the online shop.
    - Accessing appointment information in the segmented Hospital industry in Ireland is a 
challenge for patients. A solution needs to address the non-profit status, and hence budgetary
constraints, of many hospitals and high barriers to entry that result. GraphQL and Azure 
Cloud Computing are employed to develop a Hospital Appointments API that is easy to 
implement with no change to staff workflows. The use of these technologies allows for future
growth due to the capacity for complexity and scalability the provide respectively.
A GraphQL backend is built using Java Spring Boot and a simple static website is employed 
to demonstrate its use. To demonstrate real-world use two Databases have been designed
using MS SQL Server and MySQL and connected to the backend. All are deployed on Azure 
and leverage the resulting security benefits. GraphQL is used to query the database using the 
GraphQL schema. Rapid Application development was used as the software development 
methodology. This approach proved fruitful for research purposes as it has a built in 
requirement for documentation and reporting. 
The project aims to demonstrate the benefits of such new technologies and how they can be 
implemented easily and cheaply, with potential for growth built in. While it may be a simple 
implementation of GraphQL, the Soleir API successfully demonstrates its potential.
    - PhotoBackup is an alternative to Google Photos backup solution.
The solution is meant to provide similar features provided by Google Photos, the 
key difference being that the main storage location for the backup is a personal 
computer rather than cloud storage.
Google announced last year that it is phasing out the free storage of photos in June 
2021. It is timely, then, to offer users a new solution to automatically backup 
pictures and images from their phone to a secure location.
The project is meant to back up data but also to offer the possibility for the users 
to enjoy their media on multiple devices that have access to the server. When 
backed up, the pictures will be accessible on the server in their native format.
An important consideration is designing this software was to provide an alternative 
that offers users more privacy regarding their content. To this end, all data and 
metadata is intended to be hosted on the user’s computer. 
In the testing process, some users reported that they found the UI difficult to 
navigate. Others, who tested the product beyond what was requested, showed up
some weaknesses in the upload process. Nonetheless, the program never 
damaged or lost the data being treated and this is important in ensuring potential 
customers’ trust in the product. Therefore, despite some minor shortcomings, 
PhotoBackup in its current state provides a reliable backup solution respectful of 
users’ data and has thus achieved the aim and objectives of this project.
     - In a post-pandemic world, what does the future hold for tourism and the hospitality industry?
According to the International Monetary Fund (IMO), tourism “has become one of the world’s most 
important growth engines, accounting for more than 10 percent of global GDP directly and 
indirectly.”1 On top of this, this major driver employs “above 300 million globally”. The current 
global crisis has put the world at a standstill. Tourism and in particular, the hospitality industry have 
been hit the hardest through the onslaught of the pandemic. For example, the hospitality industry in 
Ireland alone “employs 180,000 people”2 but it is expected that over 100,000 people will or have lost 
their jobs.
However, there is light at the end of the tunnel. Borders are beginning to open as vaccines are being 
rolled out and special attention will be put on the recovery of the once-booming sector. There is a gap 
in the market for a platform to connect workers in the hospitality sector that will increase the access 
for job opportunities and skilled hospitality workers to aid in the revival of the tourism and hospitality 
sector.
FirstResort acts as this platform working on a two-user basis: Hosts are employers in the hospitality 
industry who when registered can post jobs available in their workplace, and connect with the most 
experienced Candidates on FirstResort; and Candidates are workers who wish to seek new 
opportunities in the hospitality industry across the globe. Candidates can search and review available 
jobs and reach out to its respective Host.
     - “My son was delighted when he got his CAO offer in September. Sadly, as the weeks have 
passed, his enthusiasm has waned, and he is finding it hard to motivate himself to log on to 
lectures. He was on campus just once - but with few around, he found it a very depressing 
experience. I fear he may drop out, remote learning is putting a huge strain on students, 
particularly first years” (Mooney, 2020). 
The COVID-19 pandemic has shifted the very nature of pedagogical life across all levels of 
education, with third level education being no exception. The sudden pivot to emergency online 
teaching at the beginning of the pandemic has drastically changed what would be considered 
as a normal teaching day for lecturing staff and students alike, with both groups intertwined in 
an increasingly complex learning curve littered with obstacles and challenges (Drumm & Jong, 
2021).
With this in mind, how can colleges and universities support students and keep them on track 
to graduate? Studying in an online world can cause students to withdraw and some of the 
reasons behind these withdrawals are the following (Varre et al, 2014):
- Technology Problems: Glitches become an issue because they add to the sense of 
frustration and disconnect. Digital poverty and students not having the same access to 
technology as others is a huge issue. 
- Lack of Teacher Immediacy: Students do not enjoy the online class because they 
cannot talk face to face. They learn better by listening and taking notes rather than 
reading, which is the only method of learning with an online class. They feel as if they 
are “talking” to a computer screen all day. It has also been noted that they think it is 
much easier for a teacher to be there in the classroom rather than on the computer. They 
feel it is not interactive enough and need someone to explain to them and show 
examples and make sure they understand it.
- Personal Connections: They do not feel that the internet classroom is the best way for 
them to learn as students. They feel more comfortable in a classroom with a teacher 
giving them directions every day where they can ask a question and get an immediate 
Executive Summary
response. The impersonal feel of Moodle likewise attributes to their inability to forge a 
personal connection to the instructor and other classmates.
NCI on Track has been created to allow student support services and lecturers alike the ability 
to check if a student is at risk of dropping out in a time when student-teacher relationships are 
struggling to survive in the online world. Traditionally if a student feels overwhelmed or 
stressed, they might seek help or advice from student support but now that these services have 
moved online it takes the personal element out of asking for help. It also hopes to keep retention 
levels at NCI as high as possible by identifying students who might drop out.
3. Additional Enhancements to Consider:#
also fix eraser-diagram-specs.md to follow real data. compare with the original frontend and backend, and update the eraser-diagram-specs.md with our real data. we have also useful data in refined_project_spec.md and in diagrams folder. we have started from PROPOSAL.md, then REQUIREMENTS.md, then INTERNIM.md, then refined_project_spec.md.
Generate additional technical diagrams.
Performance Graphs:
Create actual performance charts using your test data
Include load testing graphs showing response times under different loads
Add memory usage charts.
User Testing Evidence:
Include anonymized quotes from actual user testing sessions
Add photos of testing sessions (with permission)
Create a heatmap of UI interactions if you have analytics data.
Final Polish:
Ensure all figure references are correct (search for "Fig." to verify).
4. Demonstrating Excellence:
The report shows several markers of distinction:
Technical Depth: Detailed algorithms and implementation
Innovation: eg relationship calculator
Professional Testing: % code coverage, comprehensive test suites
User-Centric: High satisfaction scores, accessibility compliance
Scalability: Performance testing 
Future Vision: Clear roadmap for commercialization.


PS. Please, if you create tests, move them to frontend_tests and backend_tests so we have only one folder for each type. Upgrade the organization of these folders every time after you test the app. Our permanent goal is to keep the app well organized. All tests must also be emoji-free, with clear, professional respectful language and student-friendly messages (not AI-like) style. remove all emoji usage everywhere, so student-friendly and professional (not AI-like) be everywhere at the project. not AI-like. i want student project-like, i want nobody know that i use ai. let comments be not like AI-generated. Centralize all alerts in validationAlerts.js with sweetalert, not standart alerts. always update ROADMAP.md after code changes.
