1. instead of standart allert please implement sweetalert2 or something similar. i like DeletePersonModal.jsx and ConfirmDeleteModal.jsx styling so we can have with help of sweetalert2 or something similar modern allerts. 
2. rewrite all allers text to not use emoji, because using of emoji is AI-like. i want student project-like, i want nobody know that i use ai.

PS. please if you create tests move tests to frontend_tests and backend_tests because we must have only one frontend tests folder for tests. also we need to have same for backend_tests - only one. Upgrade organization of frontend_tests and backend_tests folders everytime after you tested app. our permanent goal - keep the app well organized.
