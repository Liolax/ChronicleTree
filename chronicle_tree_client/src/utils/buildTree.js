// chronicle_tree_client/src/utils/buildTree.js
// DEPRECATED: This file was used for visx/d3-hierarchy tree building. No longer used with React Flow (xyflow).
// All tree layout and transformation logic is now handled in the React Flow-based components and helpers.
// This file is safe to delete after migration is complete.

// (No exported functions remain. See src/components/Tree/Tree.jsx for new logic.)
