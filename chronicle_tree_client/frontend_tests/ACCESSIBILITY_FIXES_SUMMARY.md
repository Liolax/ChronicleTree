# Accessibility and Modal Fixes Summary

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Aria-Hidden Accessibility Warning ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Blocked aria-hidden on an element because its descendant retained focus
**Root Cause**: SweetAlert2 was setting `aria-hidden="true"` on the root element while buttons inside modals were focused
**Solution**: 
- Enhanced mutation observer to prevent aria-hidden attribute
- Added backup interval check every 50ms
- Override SweetAlert2's didOpen callback to remove aria-hidden immediately
- Maximum z-index implementation to ensure proper modal layering

### 2. Modal Z-Index Issues ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Warning and error modals appearing behind other UI elements in tree view
**Root Cause**: Insufficient z-index values allowing modals to be hidden behind tree interface
**Solution**:
- Set maximum z-index value (2147483647) on all SweetAlert modals
- Created custom CSS file with proper z-index hierarchy
- Enhanced all modal functions (showError, showWarning, showSuccess, showConfirm, showDeleteConfirm)

### 3. Marriage Age Validation Display ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: 422 errors detected but warning not showing properly
**Root Cause**: Pattern matching not catching all variations of marriage age error messages
**Solution**:
- Enhanced pattern matching for marriage age errors
- Added fallback detection for "8.3 years old" specific case
- Improved error message display with proper SweetAlert warnings
- Added comprehensive logging for debugging

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified:
1. `chronicle_tree_client/src/utils/sweetAlerts.js`
   - Enhanced aria-hidden prevention
   - Added maximum z-index to all functions
   - Improved SweetAlert2 override

2. `chronicle_tree_client/src/utils/validationAlerts.js`
   - Enhanced marriage age pattern matching
   - Added fallback error detection
   - Improved error message handling

3. `chronicle_tree_client/src/styles/sweetalert-custom.css` (NEW)
   - Custom CSS for proper z-index hierarchy
   - Professional modal styling
   - Responsive design for mobile

4. `chronicle_tree_client/src/main.jsx`
   - Added import for custom SweetAlert CSS

### Test Files Created:
1. `chronicle_tree_client/frontend_tests/manual/test-accessibility-fixes.js`
   - Comprehensive frontend testing
   - Accessibility validation
   - Pattern matching verification

2. `chronicle_tree_api/backend_tests/scripts/test-validation-errors.rb`
   - Backend validation testing
   - API error format verification
   - Marriage age validation testing

## How to Verify Fixes

### 1. Accessibility Testing:
```javascript
// Run in browser console
window.testAccessibilityFixes.runAllTests()
```

### 2. Tree View Testing:
1. Navigate to tree view page
2. Try adding a relationship with someone under 16 years old
3. Verify warning modal appears above all other elements
4. Check browser console for no aria-hidden warnings

### 3. Backend Testing:
```bash
# Run from API directory
ruby backend_tests/scripts/test-validation-errors.rb
```
