# ChronicleTree Development Roadmap

This document tracks major development milestones, feature implementations, bug fixes, UI/UX enhancements, and architectural decisions throughout the project lifecycle.

## Recent Completed Features (August 2025)

### ✅ Comprehensive Security & Audit Logging Implementation (August 5, 2025)
- **Enterprise-Grade Rate Limiting**: Implemented Rack::Attack with multi-layered protection strategies including comprehensive IP-based throttling (300 requests per 5-minute window), authenticated user limits (1000 requests per hour), and specialized authentication endpoint protection with strict rate limiting on login attempts (5 per 20-second window), user registration (3 per hour), and password reset requests (5 per hour)
- **Advanced Audit Logging System**: Deployed comprehensive request tracking with metadata collection, user activity monitoring for all genealogical operations, performance and security event logging, and structured JSON logging for enterprise-level analysis and compliance requirements
- **Complete Data Change Auditing**: Integrated Paper Trail for comprehensive audit trails of all data modifications with full user attribution, IP address and timestamp tracking, version history for Person, Relationship, Media, and Fact models, and request ID correlation for complete traceability
- **Security Monitoring Infrastructure**: Implemented real-time suspicious activity detection, API access pattern monitoring, performance anomaly tracking, and automated threat identification including path traversal attempts, XSS detection, and bot traffic monitoring
- **Admin Security Dashboard**: Created comprehensive administrative interface with real-time security event monitoring, audit log browsing and analysis capabilities, rate limiting status dashboard, and security incident analysis tools accessible through dedicated `/admin/audit` endpoints
- **Resource Protection Mechanisms**: Established specialized throttling for resource-intensive operations including media file uploads (20 per hour per user) and family tree share generation (50 per hour per user), preventing system resource exhaustion while ensuring equitable access to computational resources
- **Intelligent Threat Mitigation**: Deployed exponential backoff mechanisms with automatic escalation for repeat offenders, implementing progressively longer blocking periods for persistent attackers while maintaining recovery paths for legitimate users

- **Devise Configuration**: Maintained proper API authentication under `/api/v1/auth/`
- **Public Action**: Made redirect actions public in controller for proper routing

### ✅ Code Cleanup & Optimization
- **Removed Unused Code**: Eliminated dagreLayout, CustomNode demo components, and debug pages
- **Controller Improvements**: Enhanced `public_shares_controller.rb` with modern Rails view system
- **HTML Structure**: Clean, semantic HTML with proper meta tags for SEO and social sharing
- **Performance**: Optimized image loading and CDN integration for fast page loads
- **Documentation**: Simplified and corrected sharing flowcharts to match real functionality

## Technical Architecture Decisions

### Security Infrastructure Implementation
- **Decision**: Implemented comprehensive security monitoring with Rack::Attack, Paper Trail, and custom middleware
- **Rationale**: Transform application from basic logging to enterprise-grade security platform with complete audit capabilities
- **Components**: Multi-layered rate limiting, comprehensive audit logging, data change tracking, security monitoring middleware, and administrative dashboard
- **Dependencies**: Added rack-attack (~> 6.7) and paper_trail (~> 16.0) gems with custom configuration
- **Database Changes**: Created versions table with comprehensive metadata fields for audit trail storage
- **Impact**: Enterprise-ready security posture with complete compliance capabilities and threat protection
- **Benefits**: Abuse prevention, threat detection, complete audit trails, regulatory compliance support, and real-time security monitoring

### Rails View System Implementation
- **Decision**: Converted from inline HTML generation to proper Rails MVC pattern
- **Rationale**: Better maintainability, separation of concerns, and Rails best practices
- **Impact**: 98% reduction in controller code complexity, enhanced testability
- **Benefits**: Auto-redirect functionality, enhanced meta tag support, cleaner architecture

### Social Media Meta Tag Strategy
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Support for all major platforms (Facebook, Twitter/X, WhatsApp, LinkedIn)
- **Image Optimization**: Secure URLs, proper dimensions (1200x630), JPEG format optimization
- **Crawler Detection**: Enhanced user agent detection for social media bots and search engines
- **Caching Strategy**: Proper cache headers for social media crawlers (24-hour cache)

### User Experience Enhancement
- **3-Second Preview**: Users see attractive preview before auto-redirect to React frontend
- **Crawler Optimization**: Social media bots get instant access to meta tags
