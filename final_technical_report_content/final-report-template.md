Executive Summary
Maximum 300 words. The abstract should mention the problem being addressed, describe the technical solution, and briefly report the findings of the evaluation.


1. Introduction
This template for technical report is provided for your convenience. It should be seen as a guide rather than an obligatory form. Your individual report might require changes in terms of format or content (i.e., headings) or both.
Suggested wordcount: 6000-8000 words (starting with the Introduction up to and not including Bibliography)
1.1 Background
Why?
1.2 Aims
What? 
1.3 Technologies
How? - Brief description of the technologies used in the project. Do not copy & paste descriptions from websites here, but describe what it is and how it contributes to your project.
1.4 Structure
Brief overview of each chapter
2. System
2.1 Requirements
This section will be similar to your original requirements specification. Requirements have probably evolved somewhat since. Where this is the case explain what changed and why.
2.1.1 Functional requirements
2.1.2 Data requirements
2.1.3 User requirements
2.1.4 Environmental requirements
2.1.5 Usability requirements
2.2 Design and Architecture
Describe the design, system architecture and components used. Describe the main algorithms used in the project. (Note: use standard mathematical notations if applicable).
An architecture diagram may be useful. In case of a distributed system, it may be useful to describe functions and/or data structures in each component separately.  
2.3 Implementation
Describe the main classes/functions used in the code. Consider to show and explain interesting code snippets where appropriate.
2.4 Testing
Describe any testing tools, test plans and test specifications used in the project
2.5 Graphical User Interface (GUI) Layout
Provide screenshots of key screens and explain.
2.6 Customer testing
Provide evidence for and results of customer testing. This may include ratings or quotes from the customer.
2.7 Evaluation
How was the system evaluated and what are the results? In many cases this will include usage data and user feedback. It may also include performance evaluations, scalability, correctness, etc. depending on the focus of the project.
Quantitative results may be reported in tables or figures. Note that tables have their caption above the table and need to be cross referenced in the text (see Table 1). In many cases, tables are better to read if you skip the vertical lines.

Table 1: Performance with and without caching

Figures have their caption below the figure as shown in Figure 1. Make sure that if you use colour, the figure is still readable when printed in black & white, e.g., by using additional symbols, patterns, etc.

3. Conclusions
Describe the advantages/disadvantages, opportunities, and limits of the project.
4. Further development or research
With more resources, where could the results of this project lead to?
5. References
It is recommended that students use the APA, Berkeley, Harvard or other internationally approved style. Here is an example of the APA citation style:

Wilcox, R. V. (1991). Shifting roles and synthetic women in Star Trek: The Next Generation. Studies in Popular Culture, 13(2), 53-65.

In the text this article can be cited as “Wilcox (1991)” or “(Wilkox, 1991)”.

References to websites must include the access dates.
