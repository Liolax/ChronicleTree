Note to the Author

[This document is a template of a Product Design Specification document for a project. The template includes instructions to the author, boilerplate text, and fields that should be replaced with the values specific to the project.

Blue italicized text enclosed in square brackets ([text]) provides instructions to the document author, or describes the intent, assumptions and context for content included in this document.

Blue italicized text enclosed in angle brackets (<text>) indicates a field that should be replaced with information specific to a particular project.

Text and tables in black are provided as boilerplate examples of wording and formats that may be used or modified as appropriate to a specific project.  These are offered only as suggestions to assist in developing project documents; they are not mandatory formats.

When using this template for your project document, it is recommended that you follow these steps:
1.Replace all text enclosed in angle brackets (i.e., <Project Name>) with the correct field values. These angle brackets appear in both the body of the document and in headers and footers.  To customize fields in Microsoft Word (which display a gray background when selected):
a.Select File>Properties>Summary and fill in the Title field with the Document Name and the Subject field with the Project Name.  
b.Select File>Properties>Custom and fill in the Last Modified, Status, and Version fields with the appropriate information for this document. 
c.After you click OK to close the dialog box, update the fields throughout the document with these values by selecting Edit>Select All (or Ctrl-A) and pressing F9.  Or you can update an individual field by clicking on it and pressing F9. This must be done separately for Headers and Footers.
2.Modify boilerplate text as appropriate to the specific project. 
3.To add any new sections to the document, ensure that the appropriate header and body text styles are maintained.  Styles used for the Section Headings are Heading 1, Heading 2 and Heading 3.  Style used for boilerplate text is Body Text.
4.To update the Table of Contents, right-click and select “Update field” and choose the option- “Update entire table”
5.Before submission of the first draft of this document, delete this “Notes to the Author” page and all instructions to the author, which appear throughout the document as blue italicized text enclosed in square brackets.]

Introduction
1.1Purpose of The Product Design Specification Document
[Provide the purpose of the Product Design Specification Document. This document should be tailored to fit a particular project’s needs.]
The Product Design Specification document documents and tracks the necessary information required to effectively define architecture and system design in order to give the development team guidance on architecture of the system to be developed. The Product Design Specification document is created during the Planning Phase of the project. Its intended audience is the project manager, project team, and development team. Some portions of this document such as the user interface (UI) may on occasion be shared with the client/user, and other stakeholder whose input/approval into the UI is needed.
2General Overview and Design Guidelines/Approach
This section describes the principles and strategies to be used as guidelines when designing and implementing the system.
2.1Assumptions / Constraints / Standards
[Describe any general design assumptions / constraints / standards related to any of the project’s design]
3Architecture Design
This section outlines the system and hardware architecture design of the system that is being built.
[Describe the system architecture, how the application interacts with other applications. Not necessarily how the application itself works but, how the appropriate data is correctly passed between applications.]
3.1Logical View
[Insert any related logical views or provide a reference to where they are stored.]
3.2Hardware Architecture
[Insert any related hardware architecture documents or provide a reference to where they are stored.]
3.3Software Architecture
[Insert any software architecture documents or provide a reference to where they are stored.]
3.4Security Architecture
[Insert any related security architecture documents or provide a reference to where they are stored.]
3.5Communication Architecture
[Insert any related communication architecture documents or provide a reference to where they are stored.]
3.6Performance
[Insert any performance documents or provide a reference to where they are stored.]
4System Design
4.1Use-Cases
[Insert any related project use cases or provide a reference to where they are stored.]
4.2Database Design
[Insert any documents describing any necessary database design guidelines or provide a reference to where they are stored.]
4.3Data Conversions
[Insert any documents describing any necessary data conversions or provide a reference to where they are stored.]
4.4Application Program Interfaces
[Insert any application program interface documents or provide a reference to where they are stored.]
