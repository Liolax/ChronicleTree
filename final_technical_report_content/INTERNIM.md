1. Project Overview
ChronicleTree is a modern web application designed to help users build, visualize, and share their family trees in a way that is both intuitive and visually engaging. Unlike many traditional genealogy tools, which can feel outdated or overwhelming, ChronicleTree is built with a strong focus on user experience, offering a clean interface and interactive features. The project is a full-stack solution, with a Ruby on Rails API backend and a React frontend. Its main features include secure user authentication, dynamic tree visualization, and detailed, customizable individual profiles. What sets ChronicleTree apart is its seamless integration of robust data management with a highly interactive UI, allowing users to create a living legacy of their family’s history, complete with media galleries, timeline events, and the ability to share with others (see Fig. 1, Fig. 3).
2. Project Expected Deliverables
The successful completion of ChronicleTree will result in both comprehensive documentation and a fully functional application. The required documentation includes the Project Proposal, Ethics Approval Form, Requirements Specification, this Interim Progress Report, the Project Analysis & Design Documentation, the Final Project Report, a Declaration Cover Sheet, and a final video demonstration. On the technical side, the deliverables consist of a complete Rails API supporting CRUD operations for all core resources, a React frontend with dynamic tree visualization and profile management, secure authentication, a comprehensive test suite, and a modern, responsive UI (see Fig. 3, Fig. 4, Fig. 5, Fig. 6). Full deployment instructions and user documentation will also be provided to ensure the application can be easily set up and used by others.
3. Project Actual Targets Met
So far, ChronicleTree has moved successfully through the initial planning and requirements specification phases, with all key documents submitted. The backend API is up and running, providing user authentication, account management, and all the core models and associations needed for the app. The database schema is finalized, and the seed data now includes a realistic, multi-generational family tree, which has been invaluable for development and testing (see Fig. 2).
On the frontend, the React application is fully integrated with the backend, and the dynamic family tree visualization is already operational, featuring pan and zoom, a MiniMap, and custom node components (see Fig. 3). Profile pages display all relevant data, including facts, timeline events, media, relationships, and notes, and support full CRUD operations (see Fig. 4). The media gallery now allows uploads with user-friendly titles, file previews, and deletion, and profile picture management is fully integrated with Active Storage. Navigation and UI/UX have been refined to match the latest mockups, and profile access is now only available via the tree or person card, ensuring a clear and logical user flow. All major features are covered by automated tests, and continuous integration is in place to maintain code quality.
The technical architecture and data model have been documented with high-level diagrams (see Fig. 1, Fig. 2), and interactive UI have been developed for all key screens (see Fig. 3, Fig. 4, Fig. 5, Fig. 6). Created mockups have guided the development process and ensured alignment between the backend, frontend, and user experience goals.

4. Deliverables Yet to be Achieved
Despite the strong progress so far, there are still several important tasks left to complete before the final submission. One of my main priorities is to further improve the family tree visualization, making it more visually appealing and easier to navigate, especially for larger families. I also plan to refine the profile pages, adding more editing options and making the layout clearer and more user-friendly based on testing.
On the technical side, I hope to add some useful features such as basic export and import functionality (for example, allowing users to download or upload their tree data in a simple format), as well as improved search and filtering so users can quickly find people or events in their tree. If time allows, I would also like to implement a simple notification system to alert users about important changes or reminders.
Some of these features are ambitious, and as a student working alone, I may need to prioritize the most essential improvements to ensure the core experience is polished and reliable. My main focus will be on delivering a smooth, bug-free tree view and profile management, as these are the heart of the application. I am confident that I can achieve these goals before the deadline, but I will adjust my plans if I encounter unexpected challenges or time constraints.
The Project Analysis & Design Documentation and Final Project Report are scheduled for completion after all features are implemented, and the video demonstration will be recorded once the application is fully functional. All outstanding deliverables are on track for completion according to the project timeline, and I have contingency plans in place to address any unforeseen challenges that may arise (see Fig. 7).

5. Main Problems Encountered
Working as a solo developer on ChronicleTree has presented several challenges. Learning to master both the Rails and React ecosystems, especially advanced topics like Active Storage, JWT authentication, and React Flow, has required a significant investment of time and effort. Integrating the backend and frontend, particularly for file uploads and real-time updates, has been complex and sometimes required deep debugging. Balancing the demands of coding with the need to produce high-quality academic documentation has also been a challenge, making time management and planning essential. Debugging complex UI state and handling edge cases in tree visualization and profile management have further tested my problem-solving skills, but overcoming these obstacles has been rewarding and has contributed to my growth as a developer.
6. Expected Stumbling Blocks
Looking ahead, I anticipate several potential challenges. Implementing advanced tree features, such as dynamic centering and ensuring performance with large datasets, will require careful research and optimization. Managing client-side state in React will become increasingly complex as the application’s interactivity grows, making the selection and implementation of an appropriate state management strategy critical. Ensuring robust, secure file upload and media management, as well as achieving full accessibility and cross-browser compatibility, are also expected to be demanding tasks. Finally, preparing and delivering a clear, engaging final presentation is a personal area for development. My contingency plans include prioritizing core features, maintaining a strict development schedule, using extensive testing to catch issues early, and preparing scripts and rehearsing for the final demo.
7. Focus on Rubric
Throughout the project, I have consistently referred to the grading rubric to ensure that ChronicleTree meets the highest academic standards. In terms of communication, I am preparing to deliver a well-structured final presentation that clearly articulates the project’s innovation and technical depth. All documentation is written in a formal academic style and includes high-quality diagrams (see Fig. 1, Fig. 2). The project demonstrates technical complexity through its modern full-stack architecture and sophisticated features, and its innovation is evident in the user experience improvements over existing solutions. The chosen technologies are modern and leveraged to their full potential. My goal is to deliver a complete and well-tested application, supported by a rigorous, multi-faceted testing and evaluation plan. Project management has been a priority, and all milestones have been met to date (see Fig. 7).

8. Summary of Project Progression
In summary, ChronicleTree is progressing on schedule, with all foundational work complete and the majority of core features implemented. The backend and frontend are fully integrated, and the application is already usable for its primary purpose. The focus for the final phase is on advanced features, polish, and comprehensive testing and documentation. The project is well-positioned to deliver a high-quality, innovative solution that meets all academic and technical requirements.
