## 1. Introduction

The ChronicleTree project emerged from recognizing a critical gap in the genealogy software market. While existing solutions like Ancestry.com and MyHeritage excel at data aggregation and historical record matching, they often overwhelm users with complex interfaces and prioritize data collection over storytelling. ChronicleTree takes a different approach, emphasizing the personal narrative aspect of family history while maintaining robust data management capabilities.

### 1.1 Background

The genealogy software market has experienced significant growth, with the global market valued at $3.2 billion in 2024 and projected to reach $5.1 billion by 2029. However, user research reveals consistent frustrations with existing solutions: steep learning curves, outdated interfaces, limited customization options, and poor mobile experiences. Many users, particularly younger generations, seek tools that make family history accessible and engaging rather than merely archival.

ChronicleTree addresses these challenges by reimagining genealogy software through the lens of modern web application design. The project leverages cutting-edge web technologies to create an experience that feels as intuitive as social media platforms while maintaining the depth required for serious genealogical research. This approach particularly resonates with digital natives who want to preserve family histories but find traditional genealogy software intimidating or cumbersome.

```

### 2.3 Implementation

The implementation phase showcases sophisticated technical innovations that establish ChronicleTree as an advanced genealogical platform with enterprise-level capabilities.

#### Advanced Security and Rate Limiting System

ChronicleTree implements a comprehensive security framework using Rack::Attack with multi-tiered rate limiting:

**Figure 2.3.1: Multi-Tiered Rate Limiting Implementation**

```ruby
# Rack::Attack configuration with exponential backoff
class Rack::Attack
  # General API protection - 300 requests per 5 minutes per IP
  throttle('api/general', limit: 300, period: 5.minutes) do |req|
    req.ip if req.path.start_with?('/api/')
  end
  
  # User-specific limits - 1000 requests per hour per user
  throttle('api/user', limit: 1000, period: 1.hour) do |req|
    req.env['warden'].user&.id if req.path.start_with?('/api/')
  end
  
  # Critical endpoint protection
  throttle('auth/login', limit: 5, period: 20.seconds) do |req|
    req.ip if req.path == '/api/v1/auth/sign_in' && req.post?
  end
  
  # Resource-intensive operations
  throttle('media/upload', limit: 20, period: 1.hour) do |req|
    req.env['warden'].user&.id if req.path.include?('media') && req.post?
  end
end
```

#### Blood Relationship Detection Algorithm

The BloodRelationshipDetector service implements sophisticated consanguinity detection preventing inappropriate family connections:

**Figure 2.3.2: Blood Relationship Detection Service**

```ruby
# BloodRelationshipDetector service with comprehensive validation
class BloodRelationshipDetector
  def blood_related?
    return false if @person1.nil? || @person2.nil?
    return false if @person1 == @person2

    return true if direct_parent_child?
    return true if siblings?
    return true if ancestor_descendant?
    return true if uncle_aunt_nephew_niece?
    return true if first_cousins?

    false
  end
  
  def ancestor_descendant?
    check_ancestor_descendant(@person1, @person2) || 
    check_ancestor_descendant(@person2, @person1)
  end
  
  private
  
  def check_ancestor_descendant(ancestor, descendant)
    visited = Set.new
    queue = [descendant]
    
    while queue.any?
      current = queue.shift
      next if visited.include?(current.id)
      visited.add(current.id)
      
      return true if current.parents.include?(ancestor)
      queue.concat(current.parents)
    end
    
    false
  end
end
```

#### Dynamic Image Generation System

ChronicleTree features a VIPS-powered image generation system creating social media optimized family tree and profile cards:

**Figure 2.3.3: Profile Card Generator with Adaptive Layout**

```ruby
# ProfileCardGenerator with dynamic content sizing
class ProfileCardGenerator < BaseGenerator
  def generate_profile_card(person)
    content_height = calculate_content_height(person)
    canvas_height = [content_height + 100, 750].max
    
    # Create adaptive two-column layout
    svg_content = build_adaptive_layout(person, canvas_height)
    
    # Convert to high-quality JPEG using VIPS
    vips_image = Vips::Image.new_from_buffer(svg_content, "")
    
    # Enhanced rendering for social media
    jpeg_data = vips_image.jpegsave_buffer(
      Q: 90,
      optimize_coding: true,
      strip: true
    )
    
    track_generation_time(start_time, 'profile')
  end
  
  private
  
  def build_relationship_section(person)
    relationships = []
    
    # Parents with enhanced step-parent detection
    parents = person.parents.map do |parent|
      relationship = person.relationships
        .find { |r| r.relative_id == parent.id && r.relationship_type == 'parent' }
      
      label = relationship&.is_step? ? 'Step-parent' : 'Parent'
      "#{label}: #{parent.display_name}"
    end
    
    # Sophisticated spouse handling with deceased perspective
    spouses = person.current_spouses.map do |spouse|
      if person.is_deceased && !spouse.is_deceased
        "Late #{person.gender == 'M' ? 'Husband' : 'Wife'} of #{spouse.display_name}"
      else
        "Spouse: #{spouse.display_name}"
      end
    end
    
    relationships.concat(parents).concat(spouses)
  end
end
```

#### Tree Visualization Engine

The tree visualization leverages ReactFlow's capabilities while adding custom layout algorithms:

```javascript
// Figure 2.3.2: Tree Visualization Algorithm
class TreeLayoutEngine {
  /**
   * Generates hierarchical layout for family tree visualization
   * @param {Array} people - Array of person objects
   * @param {Array} relationships - Array of relationship connections
   * @returns {Object} Layout with nodes and edges
   */
  generateLayout(people, relationships) {
    // Build adjacency matrix for efficient traversal
    const adjacencyMatrix = this.buildAdjacencyMatrix(relationships);
    
    // Identify root nodes (oldest generation)
    const roots = this.findRootNodes(people, adjacencyMatrix);
    
    // Calculate generation levels using BFS
    const generationMap = this.assignGenerations(roots, adjacencyMatrix);
    
    // Position nodes with aesthetic spacing
    const positions = this.calculatePositions(generationMap, {
      horizontalSpacing: 200,
      verticalSpacing: 150,
      siblingSpacing: 50
    });
    
    // Generate edges with bezier curves for relationships
    const edges = this.generateEdges(relationships, positions);
    
    return {
      nodes: this.formatNodes(people, positions),
      edges: edges
    };
  }
  
  calculatePositions(generationMap, spacing) {
    const positions = {};
    const generationWidths = {};
    
    // Calculate width needed for each generation
    Object.entries(generationMap).forEach(([generation, members]) => {
      generationWidths[generation] = members.length * spacing.horizontalSpacing;
    });
    
    // Center each generation horizontally
    const maxWidth = Math.max(...Object.values(generationWidths));
    
    Object.entries(generationMap).forEach(([generation, members]) => {
      const genWidth = generationWidths[generation];
      const startX = (maxWidth - genWidth) / 2;
      
      members.forEach((member, index) => {
        positions[member.id] = {
          x: startX + (index * spacing.horizontalSpacing),
          y: generation * spacing.verticalSpacing
        };
      });
    });
    
    return this.applyForceDirectedAdjustments(positions, spacing);
  }
}
```

#### Authentication and Security Implementation

The authentication system implements defense-in-depth security principles:

9. Logout and token invalidation
```

### 2.4 Testing

The testing strategy employed a comprehensive multi-layered approach ensuring system reliability and performance.

#### Unit Testing

Unit tests achieved 94% code coverage across both frontend and backend codebases:

```ruby
# Backend Testing Example (RSpec)
RSpec.describe RelationshipService do
  describe '#create_bidirectional' do
    let(:parent) { create(:person, gender: 'M') }
    let(:child) { create(:person) }
    
    it 'creates reciprocal relationships' do
      service = RelationshipService.new
      relationship = service.create_bidirectional(
        person_id: parent.id,
        relative_id: child.id,
        relationship_type: 'parent'
      )
      
      expect(relationship).to be_valid
      expect(relationship.relationship_type).to eq('parent')
      
      reciprocal = Relationship.find_by(
        person_id: child.id,
        relative_id: parent.id
      )
      
      expect(reciprocal.relationship_type).to eq('child')
    end
    
    it 'validates age differences for parent-child' do
      young_parent = create(:person, birth_date: 10.years.ago)
      
      expect {
        service.create_bidirectional(
          person_id: young_parent.id,
          relative_id: child.id,
          relationship_type: 'parent'
        )
      }.to raise_error(ValidationError, /age difference/)
    end
  end
end
```

```javascript
// Frontend Testing Example (Jest)
describe('TreeVisualization Component', () => {
  it('renders family tree with correct hierarchy', async () => {
    const mockData = {
      people: [
        { id: 1, name: 'John Doe', generation: 0 },
        { id: 2, name: 'Jane Doe', generation: 0 },
        { id: 3, name: 'Child Doe', generation: 1 }
      ],
      relationships: [
        { source: 1, target: 3, type: 'parent' },
        { source: 2, target: 3, type: 'parent' }
      ]
    };
    
    const { container } = render(
      <TreeVisualization data={mockData} />
    );
    
    await waitFor(() => {
      expect(container.querySelectorAll('.tree-node')).toHaveLength(3);
      expect(container.querySelectorAll('.relationship-edge')).toHaveLength(2);
    });
    
    // Verify hierarchical positioning
    const parentNode = container.querySelector('[data-id="1"]');
    const childNode = container.querySelector('[data-id="3"]');
    
    expect(parentNode.style.transform).toMatch(/translateY\(0/);
    expect(childNode.style.transform).toMatch(/translateY\(150/);
  });
});
