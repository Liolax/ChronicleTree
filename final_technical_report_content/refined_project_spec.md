## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. Purpose of The Product Design Specification Document

The Product Design Specification document describes the system architecture and overall system design of the ChronicleTree genealogy management web application. This document serves as the authoritative technical guide for the development team, project manager, and stakeholders throughout the project lifecycle. It captures the architectural decisions, design patterns, and implementation strategies that form the foundation of this modern family tree visualization platform.

The document provides comprehensive guidance on system construction, integration patterns, and user interface design principles. Certain sections, particularly those related to user interface design and user experience workflows, may be shared with clients and stakeholders to gather feedback and ensure alignment with user expectations.

## 2. General Overview and Design Guidelines/Approach

ChronicleTree is built on a modern full-stack architecture, featuring a React 19 frontend with Vite build tooling and a Ruby on Rails 8.0.2 API backend. The system implements a hybrid approach for background processing: development environments use Sidekiq with Redis for debugging and real-time monitoring, while production uses Rails 8's Solid Queue for simplified deployment without external dependencies. Caching follows a similar pattern with memory store in development and Solid Cache in production. The application addresses the limitations of traditional genealogy software through modern design patterns and robust technical architecture that prioritizes both user experience and data integrity while utilizing current web technologies.

### 2.1. Assumptions/Constraints/Standards

The development environment assumes compatibility with modern web browsers supporting ES6+ JavaScript and WebAssembly for image processing. The frontend uses Vite as the build tool, while the backend relies on Ruby 3.3.7 with Rails 8.0.2. The system implements a hybrid approach for background processing: development uses Sidekiq with Redis for real-time job monitoring and debugging, while production utilizes Rails 8's Solid Queue for simplified deployment without external dependencies. These technical requirements ensure access to modern development features while maintaining broad compatibility with current deployment platforms.

The business logic adheres to established genealogical principles, where family relationships maintain biological and legal precedence. For instance, step-relationships are formed exclusively through marriage to a biological family member, and relationships involving deceased spouses are temporally validated for accuracy. To balance user experience and system performance, media uploads are constrained to a 10MB file size limit.

Architecturally, the system follows RESTful API design principles, using JSON for all data exchange. Security is centered on JWT authentication for API access control, and responsive design principles ensure a seamless experience on mobile devices. The application implements accessibility features including ARIA labels, focus management, and keyboard navigation support to improve usability for users with diverse abilities.

## 3. Architecture Design

### 3.1 Logical View

ChronicleTree employs a client-server architecture with a clear separation of concerns between the frontend and backend. This structure ensures modularity and scalability while supporting independent development and deployment of system components. The client-side, built with React 19 and Vite, handles all user interface elements, including the family tree visualization powered by ReactFlow, relationship management, and media galleries. It communicates with the backend via HTTP/HTTPS requests following RESTful conventions. The server-side, implemented as a Rails 8.0.2 API, manages authentication through Devise JWT, business logic through dedicated service classes, data modeling, and file storage via Active Storage, interacting with a PostgreSQL database to persist user data. The architectural relationship is visually detailed in the System Architecture Overview (Fig. 3.1.1).

**Figure 3.1.1: System Architecture Overview**  
![System Architecture Overview](diagrams/system_architecture_eraser.md)

### 3.2 Hardware Architecture

The ChronicleTree application is designed for a distributed hardware environment, supporting both local development and cloud-based production deployments. This flexible architecture enables cost-effective development while providing a clear migration path to enterprise-scale deployments.

For development, a standard desktop or laptop with at least 8GB of RAM, a dual-core processor, and SSD storage is sufficient. In production, the architecture supports both traditional servers and containerized environments. The Rails API backend runs efficiently on a standard Linux server with a minimum of 4GB of RAM and a multi-core processor. The PostgreSQL database requires adequate storage with backup capabilities, preferably on SSDs for optimal query performance.

Cloud deployments can leverage containerization for horizontal scaling, with a load balancer distributing requests and database clustering for redundancy. A Content Delivery Network (CDN) can enhance media file delivery, improving user experience through geographically distributed caching. The progression from a development setup to a full production environment is illustrated in the Deployment Architecture diagram (Fig. 3.2.1) and the deployment pipeline progression (see Fig. 3.2.2).

**Figure 3.2.1: Deployment Architecture Diagram**  
![Deployment Architecture](diagrams/deployment_architecture_eraser.md)

**Figure 3.2.2: Deployment Pipeline Progression**  
![Deployment Pipeline](diagrams/deployment_pipeline_progression.md)

The deployment pipeline clearly demonstrates the technology evolution from development to production environments. Development environments utilize Sidekiq with Redis for real-time job monitoring and debugging capabilities, while staging and production environments leverage Rails 8's Solid Queue for simplified deployment without external dependencies. This hybrid approach provides the best of both worlds: enhanced developer experience with immediate feedback during development, and streamlined production deployment with minimal infrastructure requirements.

### 3.3 Software Architecture

The frontend architecture is centered on React 19, using modern hooks for state management and concurrent features for optimal performance. The interactive family tree is powered by ReactFlow (@xyflow/react v12.8.2), providing professional-grade rendering and navigation capabilities. Styling is handled by Tailwind CSS for a consistent, utility-first design approach. Client-side routing is managed by React Router, and API communication is handled by Axios with TanStack React Query for efficient data fetching and caching. Form management utilizes React Hook Form for performance and developer experience.

The backend is built on Ruby on Rails 8.0.2, following the MVC pattern with API-only configuration. Active Storage manages file attachments with cloud compatibility, supporting both local disk storage in development and cloud providers in production. User authentication is handled by Devise with JWT token support, and Active Model Serializers format JSON responses for consistent API output. Background jobs, such as share image generation with Ruby VIPS, use a hybrid approach: Sidekiq with Redis in development for debugging capabilities, and Rails 8's Solid Queue in production for simplified deployment. Caching is implemented through memory store in development and Solid Cache in production environments. A comprehensive summary of the technologies used can be found in the Technology Stack diagram (Fig. 3.3.1).

**Figure 3.3.1: Technology Stack Diagram**  
![Technology Stack](diagrams/technology_stack_scema.html)

The frontend is organized into a hierarchical component structure following atomic design principles. Profile management components, such as RelationshipManager.jsx and MediaForm.jsx, are organized in dedicated directories by feature. Core logic is handled by utility modules like improvedRelationshipCalculator.js and familyTreeHierarchicalLayout.js, which implement the genealogical algorithms and tree positioning logic. The Tree directory contains visualization components like FamilyTreeFlow.jsx and CustomNode.jsx, implementing the core family tree rendering logic using ReactFlow. Core family tree visualization component from FamilyTreeFlow.jsx is shown below (Fig. 3.3.2).

  const [searchParams] = useSearchParams();
  const [isAddPersonModalOpen, setAddPersonModalOpen] = useState(false);

    if (rootPersonId) {
      const result = collectConnectedFamily(rootPersonId, data.nodes, data.edges);
      filteredNodes = result.persons;
      filteredEdges = result.relationships;
    }

    // Figure out relationships to root person
    const rootPerson = rootPersonId
      ? filteredNodes.find(n => n.id === rootPersonId)
      : null;
    
    return { nodes: filteredNodes, edges: filteredEdges, rootPerson };
  }, [data, rootPersonId, hasSetDefaultRoot, showUnrelated]);

  // ... rest of component implementation
};

export default FamilyTree;
```

The backend follows Rails conventions with versioned API controllers under the api/v1 namespace. The controllers directory contains endpoints for managing people, relationships, and media with comprehensive error handling. Data models encapsulate business logic including validation rules and relationship constraints, while serializers ensure consistent JSON formatting across all API responses. Service classes like BloodRelationshipDetector, UnifiedRelationshipCalculator, and TreeBuilder handle complex business logic operations.

### 3.4 Security Architecture

Security is implemented through multiple layers, beginning with JWT-based authentication using the devise-jwt gem for stateless session management. The authentication system includes dedicated controllers under `api/v1/auth/` namespace with SessionsController for login/logout and RegistrationsController for user signup. Each API request includes a signed token in the Authorization header (`Bearer <token>`), validated through the `authenticate_user!` before_action in the BaseController to ensure authorized access. 

The JWT implementation includes a denylist revocation strategy through the JwtDenylist model, allowing for secure token invalidation on logout. Tokens expire after 1 day as configured in the Devise initializer. The authentication flow is managed client-side through a React AuthContext that handles token storage in localStorage and automatic API header configuration.

The authentication endpoints include:
- `POST /api/v1/auth/sign_in` for user login with email/password
- `POST /api/v1/auth` for user registration with name, email, password, and confirmation
- `DELETE /api/v1/auth/sign_out` for secure logout with token revocation
- `POST /api/v1/auth/password` for password reset functionality (using Devise's recoverable module)

Input validation occurs at multiple levels throughout the application stack. Client-side validation provides immediate user feedback using React Hook Form for form management, while server-side validation ensures data integrity through Rails model validations and custom validators. The Rails Strong Parameters feature prevents mass assignment vulnerabilities by explicitly defining permitted attributes for each endpoint - for example, the PeopleController only permits specific fields like `:first_name`, `:last_name`, `:date_of_birth`, `:date_of_death`, `:gender`, and `:is_deceased`.

File upload security utilizes Active Storage with local disk storage in development environments. The system enforces file type and size restrictions, with user-uploaded content stored separately from application files using unique identifiers to prevent directory traversal attacks. All uploaded files are served through Active Storage's secure URL generation with built-in access controls.

Database security includes SSL/TLS connections enforced in production through `config.force_ssl = true` and `config.assume_ssl = true` settings. Parameterized queries through Active Record prevent SQL injection attacks. Most importantly, strict user-scoped data access ensures users can only access their own family data - all controllers use `current_user.people` associations to enforce data isolation, preventing unauthorized access to other users' family information.

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is configured to allow requests from specific development origins (localhost:5173, 5174, 5175, 5178) with controlled header exposure including the Authorization header for JWT tokens. Production deployments include SSL auto-certification via Let's Encrypt as configured in the deploy.yml. Regular security audits are maintained using Brakeman static analysis, which is included in the development dependencies to scan for common Rails security vulnerabilities.

The application implements comprehensive security monitoring and protection through multiple integrated systems designed to provide defense-in-depth protection. Rack::Attack provides multi-layered protection with customized throttling strategies that balance security with user experience. The rate limiting system implements IP-based limits to prevent brute force attacks, allowing 300 requests per 5 minutes from any single IP address, while user-specific limits manage authenticated traffic with more generous allowances of 1000 requests per hour per individual account. Critical endpoints receive specialized protection with strict rate limiting designed to prevent credential-based attacks - login attempts are restricted to 5 attempts per 20-second window, registration is limited to 3 new accounts per hour per IP address, and password reset requests are capped at 5 per hour. Resource-intensive operations that consume significant server resources are managed through dedicated throttling mechanisms, with media file uploads limited to 20 uploads per hour per user and family tree share generation restricted to 50 share creations per hour per user.

Paper Trail integration provides comprehensive audit logging that tracks all data modifications with complete attribution including user identification, IP addresses, user agents, and request IDs. The AuditLogging concern extends this functionality by providing detailed activity tracking for all genealogical operations with specialized logging for person management, relationship changes, media uploads, and sharing activities. Security events, suspicious activities, and rate limit violations are automatically logged with structured JSON formatting designed for analysis and future administrative interface development.

Custom SecurityMiddleware tracks all API access patterns, monitoring for suspicious behavior including slow requests, repeated failures, potential attack vectors, and bot traffic. The system maintains comprehensive logs of request patterns, response times, and error rates to identify potential security threats through automated analysis of access patterns and user behavior anomalies. All security events, audit logs, and rate limit violations are automatically logged with structured JSON formatting for analysis and future administrative interface development. The complete security architecture and monitoring flow is illustrated in the Security Architecture diagram (Fig. 3.4.1) and the API monitoring with rate limiting is shown in Fig. 3.4.2.

### 3.5 Communication Architecture

The API design follows RESTful principles with consistent URL patterns and appropriate HTTP verb usage. All endpoints return JSON responses with standardized error formats, enabling predictable client-side error handling. The API versioning strategy uses URL prefixes (/api/v1/), allowing backward compatibility as the API evolves while supporting gradual client migration. Core API controller is represented below (Fig. 3.5.1).

**Figure 3.5.1: Rails API Controller Implementation**

```ruby
# Core API controller from app/controllers/api/v1/people_controller.rb
module Api
  module V1
    class PeopleController < BaseController
      before_action :set_person, only: %i[show update destroy tree relatives]

      def index
        people = current_user.people
        render json: people, each_serializer: Api::V1::PersonSerializer, status: :ok
      end

      def show
        render json: @person, serializer: Api::V1::PersonSerializer, status: :ok
      end

      def create
        ActiveRecord::Base.transaction do
          person = current_user.people.build(person_params)
          is_first_person = current_user.people.count == 0
          rel_type = params[:person][:relation_type]
          rel_person_id = params[:person][:related_person_id]
          
          if !is_first_person && (rel_type.blank? || rel_person_id.blank?)
            render json: { errors: [ "Please select both a relationship type and a person to connect to. Both fields are required when adding new family members." ] }, status: :unprocessable_entity
            raise ActiveRecord::Rollback
          end
          
          if person.save
            if rel_type.present? && rel_person_id.present?
              related_person = current_user.people.find(rel_person_id)
              
              # Parent-child age validation
              if ['child', 'parent'].include?(rel_type)
                if rel_type == 'child'
                  validation_result = related_person.can_be_parent_of?(person)
                elsif rel_type == 'parent'
                  validation_result = person.can_be_parent_of?(related_person)
                end

                unless validation_result[:valid]
                  render json: { 
                    errors: [validation_result[:error]]
                  }, status: :unprocessable_entity
                  raise ActiveRecord::Rollback
                end
              end
              
              case rel_type
              when 'child'
                Relationship.create!(person_id: rel_person_id, relative_id: person.id, relationship_type: 'child')
                Relationship.create!(person_id: person.id, relative_id: rel_person_id, relationship_type: 'parent')
              when 'spouse'
                # Determine if this should be an ex-spouse relationship
                is_ex_spouse = person.date_of_death.present?
                
                # Check if selected person already has a current spouse
                if !is_ex_spouse && related_person.current_spouses.any?
                  current_spouse_names = related_person.current_spouses.map(&:full_name).join(', ')
                  render json: { 
                    errors: ["#{related_person.full_name} already has a current spouse (#{current_spouse_names}). A person can only have one current spouse at a time."]
                  }, status: :unprocessable_entity
                  raise ActiveRecord::Rollback
                end
                
                Relationship.create!(
                  person_id: person.id, 
                  relative_id: rel_person_id, 
                  relationship_type: 'spouse',
                  is_ex: is_ex_spouse
                )
              end
            end
            
            render json: person, serializer: Api::V1::PersonSerializer, status: :created
          else
            render json: { errors: person.errors.full_messages }, status: :unprocessable_entity
          end
        end
      rescue StandardError => e
        render json: { errors: ["An error occurred while creating the person"] }, status: :internal_server_error
      end

      private

      def set_person
        @person = current_user.people.find(params[:id])
      rescue ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound
        render json: { error: "Person not found" }, status: :not_found
      end

      def person_params
        params.require(:person).permit(
          :first_name, :last_name, :maiden_name, :nickname,
          :date_of_birth, :date_of_death, :place_of_birth, :place_of_death,
          :gender, :biography, :occupation, :education
        )
      end
    end
  end
end
```

Request/response cycles include comprehensive audit logging with request ID tracking for debugging and compliance purposes. Each request is assigned a unique identifier for tracing through the system, and all user activities are logged with detailed metadata including IP addresses, user agents, and action types. The application implements comprehensive rate limiting via Rack::Attack with multiple throttling strategies designed to provide robust protection while maintaining optimal user experience.

The rate limiting implementation establishes comprehensive protection through multiple specialized strategies. General API protection provides baseline security by limiting any single IP address to a maximum of 300 requests within a 5-minute window, effectively preventing brute force attacks and automated scraping attempts while ensuring legitimate users can access the application without restriction. For authenticated users, the system implements more generous user-specific limits allowing up to 1000 requests per hour per individual account, recognizing that registered users typically require higher access volumes for normal family tree management activities.

Critical authentication endpoints receive specialized protection with strict rate limiting designed to prevent credential-based attacks. Login attempts are restricted to 5 attempts per 20-second window per IP address, providing robust defense against password guessing while allowing legitimate users reasonable retry opportunities. User registration is limited to 3 new accounts per hour per IP address to prevent automated account creation, while password reset requests are capped at 5 per hour to balance security with legitimate recovery needs.

Resource-intensive operations that consume significant server computational power or storage are managed through dedicated throttling mechanisms. Media file uploads are limited to 20 uploads per hour per user, preventing system resource exhaustion while accommodating normal family photo and document sharing activities. Family tree share generation, which involves complex image rendering processes, is restricted to 50 share creations per hour per user, ensuring equitable access to this computationally expensive feature across all users.

The system implements progressive exponential backoff mechanisms that automatically escalate rate limiting severity for repeat offenders. Users or IP addresses that consistently violate rate limits experience progressively longer blocking periods, effectively deterring persistent attackers while providing recovery paths for legitimate users who may have accidentally exceeded limits. This graduated response system maintains security effectiveness while minimizing impact on genuine application usage.

Audit trails are maintained using Paper Trail for comprehensive data change tracking, logging all modifications to genealogical data with user attribution, IP addresses, and timestamps. The system includes security monitoring middleware that tracks suspicious activities, API access patterns, and performance metrics. Admin users can access comprehensive audit reports through dedicated endpoints including security events, rate limit status, and user activity logs.

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policies enable secure cross-origin requests while preventing unauthorized domain access. The configuration supports both development environments with permissive policies and production environments with strict origin validation. Preflight request handling ensures smooth operation of complex API calls.

The comprehensive API structure is documented in the API Endpoints Structure diagram (Fig. 3.5.2).

### 3.6 Performance

Performance optimization occurs at multiple levels throughout the application stack. Database queries utilize eager loading through Active Record's `.includes()` method to prevent N+1 query problems, as implemented in the PersonSerializer and image generation services. Strategic indexes are configured on frequently queried columns including user_id, person_id, relative_id, and relationship_type to ensure efficient data retrieval. The relationships table includes specialized indexes for performance-critical queries such as `index_relationships_on_type_and_deceased` and `index_relationships_on_shared_parent_id`.

Frontend performance utilizes React 19's concurrent features including automatic batching and transitions for smooth user interactions. The family tree visualization implements viewport-based rendering through ReactFlow's built-in virtualization, ensuring consistent performance regardless of tree size. Component optimization uses React's `useMemo` hook for expensive calculations, particularly in the family tree data processing and layout algorithms, with results cached for the duration of the request.

Caching strategies operate at multiple levels to minimize redundant processing. Browser caching for static assets uses fingerprinted filenames with far-future expiration headers configured through Vite's build process. The application uses environment-specific caching: memory store in development for rapid iteration, Rails 8's Solid Cache in production for database-backed caching without external dependencies, eliminating the need for Redis infrastructure in production. Server-side caching through Rails' built-in mechanisms reduces repeated database hits across all environments.

Background job processing uses a hybrid approach optimized for each environment. Development utilizes Sidekiq with Redis for real-time job monitoring and debugging capabilities, while production employs Rails 8's Solid Queue for simplified deployment without external dependencies. This includes share image generation with Ruby VIPS, email notifications for sharing invitations, and comprehensive audit logging. Job prioritization ensures time-sensitive operations like authentication emails process quickly while bulk operations queue appropriately. The performance monitoring infrastructure tracks job execution times and queue depths to identify bottlenecks.

## 4. System Design

### 4.1 Use Cases

The primary user workflow guides individuals through comprehensive family history documentation. Beginning with user registration, the system provides an intuitive path through family member creation, relationship definition, and rich profile development. Each interaction builds upon previous actions, creating a natural progression from simple family structures to complex multi-generational trees.

Key use cases encompass the full genealogical research lifecycle. Users create family trees by progressively adding members and defining their interconnections. The relationship management system supports complex scenarios including multiple marriages, step-families, and in-law relationships. Rich profile capabilities enable detailed biographical documentation including timeline events, media galleries, and custom facts. The sharing workflow allows users to generate public links for their family trees, enabling collaboration with relatives or sharing discoveries with genealogical communities.

The complete user journey from registration through tree sharing is visualized in the User Workflow diagram (Fig. 4.1.1), with detailed flowcharts showing each interaction pattern throughout the system.

### 4.2 Database Design

The database architecture represents a carefully balanced approach between normalization principles and practical performance requirements, leveraging PostgreSQL's advanced capabilities to deliver both data integrity and operational efficiency. The schema design prioritizes genealogical accuracy while maintaining the flexibility needed for diverse family structures and cultural variations in relationship definitions.

The database schema balances normalization with query performance, utilizing PostgreSQL's advanced features for data integrity and efficiency. The core entity model centers on the people table, with relationships defined through a separate relationships table enabling bidirectional connections. This design supports complex family structures while maintaining referential integrity.

The people table serves as the central entity, storing essential biographical information including names, dates, gender, and deceased status through the `is_deceased` boolean field. Each person record belongs to a specific user through the `user_id` foreign key, ensuring strict data isolation and privacy between different family trees. This user-scoped approach prevents unauthorized access to family data while enabling multiple users to maintain independent genealogical records.

The facts table enables extensible profile information without schema modifications, supporting diverse cultural and historical documentation needs. This flexible approach allows users to add custom biographical details such as occupations, military service, religious affiliations, or any culturally significant information without requiring database schema changes. The timeline_items table captures significant life moments with temporal and geographic context, enabling rich biographical narratives that extend beyond basic birth and death dates.

Relationship modeling utilizes a join table approach with relationship_type enumeration and additional metadata fields including `is_ex` and `is_deceased` status flags. This design supports complex scenarios including multiple marriages with date ranges, parent-child relationships, and calculated sibling relationships based on shared parentage through the `shared_parent_id` field. The bidirectional nature of relationships is handled through careful constraint design ensuring data consistency.

The relationships table implements a sophisticated approach to genealogical connections, storing direct relationships (parent, child, spouse, sibling) while enabling the calculation of extended family relationships (grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins) through algorithmic traversal. The `shared_parent_id` field facilitates step-family relationship tracking, allowing the system to distinguish between full siblings, half-siblings, and step-siblings based on shared biological or legal parentage.

Media storage utilizes Active Storage's polymorphic associations through the media table, enabling file attachments to multiple entity types. This flexibility supports profile photos, document scans, and multimedia content while maintaining consistent access patterns. The system includes specialized tables for social sharing functionality, with the share_images table managing automatically generated promotional content and the shares table tracking social media distribution through polymorphic associations

The database includes comprehensive security and auditing capabilities through dedicated tables. The jwt_denylists table manages token revocation for secure authentication, while user-scoped access patterns ensure complete data isolation between family trees. All sensitive operations maintain audit trails through systematic logging, supporting both security monitoring and genealogical research verification.

Strategic indexing optimizes query performance for common genealogical operations. Composite indexes on the relationships table support efficient relationship traversal, while individual indexes on frequently queried columns ensure responsive user experiences even with large family datasets. The database design anticipates growth patterns typical in genealogical research, where family trees expand both vertically through generations and horizontally through extended family connections.

The complete database structure is illustrated in the Database Schema Design diagram (Fig. 4.2.1), with detailed breakdowns available in the domain-specific database diagrams (see Fig. 4.2.2-4.2.6).

### 4.3 Data Conversions

The current ChronicleTree implementation handles data conversions through standard Rails conventions and built-in Active Storage capabilities, combined with React-based frontend validation and processing. The system focuses on reliable data processing for genealogical information with comprehensive temporal validation to ensure chronological accuracy.

Date handling utilizes Rails' standard `Date.parse()` functionality for birth and death dates, supporting ISO 8601 format input from HTML5 date fields. The frontend implements browser-native date inputs with validation constraints including maximum date validation (preventing future dates) and temporal relationship validation. The system implements comprehensive temporal validation to prevent impossible family relationships, such as children born after parents' death or parents younger than their children. Age calculations use precise algorithms that account for leap years and provide user-friendly error messages with specific date formatting through JavaScript's `toLocaleDateString()` method for consistent display across different locales.

Media processing utilizes Rails' Active Storage framework with polymorphic associations, allowing file attachments to people through the media table. The frontend MediaForm component implements comprehensive file validation including type checking (images: JPG, PNG, GIF; documents: PDF; media: MP4, WEBM, MP3, WAV), size restrictions (10MB limit), and real-time preview generation using `URL.createObjectURL()`. The system uses `FormData` for multipart form submissions with proper content-type headers. Basic image processingng capabilities are provided through the Ruby VIPS library for share image generation, creating optimized social media preview images.

The frontend implements multi-layered form validation using React Hook Form with custom validation rules. Input sanitization includes `.trim()` for text fields, type conversion for numeric inputs, and comprehensive validation for genealogical constraints. The validation system includes real-time feedback for relationship constraints (marriage age validation, parent-child age differences, sibling age gap warnings), temporal consistency checks (birth/death date validation), and blood relationship detection to prevent impossible family connections.

API responses use Active Model Serializers to ensure consistent JSON formatting across all endpoints. The person serializer provides comprehensive relationship data including relatives, siblings, and in-law connections. All genealogical data maintains strict user-scoped access patterns, ensuring complete data isolation between different family trees. Client-side data processing includes relationship calculation algorithms that traverse family connections to determine precise relationships between individuals, supporting over 20 relationship types with gender-specific terminology.

The system implements sophisticated validation logic including age difference calculations for parent-child relationships (minimum 12-year gap), marriage age validation (minimum 16 years), and sibling age gap warnings (maximum 25-year difference). String processing includes custom label handling in the facts system, allowing users to create custom biographical categories while maintaining data consistency. All user inputs undergo both client-side validation for immediate feedback and server-side validation for data integrity through Rails model validations and custom validators.

### 4.4 Application Program Interfaces

The relationship calculator API represents the core innovation of ChronicleTree, implementing complex genealogical logic through elegant abstractions. The calculateRelationshipToRoot() function traverses family connections to determine precise relationships between any two individuals, supporting over 20 relationship types with gender-specific terminology. The algorithm handles edge cases including multiple paths between individuals, choosing the most direct biological relationship when alternatives exist.

The decision-making process for relationship creation follows a sophisticated validation tree that ensures genealogical accuracy and prevents impossible relationships. This logic flow guides users through appropriate relationship selections while enforcing business rules such as preventing marriages between close blood relatives and validating temporal consistency (see Fig. 4.4.1).

**Figure 4.4.1: Relationship Creation Decision Tree**  
![Relationship Decision Tree](diagrams/decision_tree.md)

The API design emphasizes clarity and consistency across all endpoints. Each endpoint follows predictable patterns with comprehensive documentation generated through API blueprints. Request validation ensures data integrity while providing helpful error messages for client-side handling. Response formats include relationship metadata enabling rich user interface interactions, such as highlighting connection paths in the tree visualization.

Media management APIs provide secure file handling with automatic optimization. Upload endpoints accept multiple file formats while enforcing size limits and type restrictions. The system generates multiple image sizes for responsive display while preserving original files for download. Metadata APIs enable rich media organization with titles, descriptions, and date information, supporting comprehensive family archives.

The complete relationship type support is detailed in the Relationship Types diagram (Fig. 4.4.2), with API endpoint documentation available in the specific API diagrams (Fig. 4.4.3-4.4.8).

### 4.6 Performance

System design for performance focuses on ensuring a responsive user experience, even with large data volumes. This is achieved through comprehensive database indexing on key columns including person_id, relative_id, relationship_type, and specialized composite indexes like `index_relationships_on_type_and_deceased`. Optimized query structures utilize Active Record's `.includes()` method to prevent N+1 query problems, particularly in relationship traversal and image generation services.

Performance testing on the current implementation with 18 family members and 54 relationships demonstrates excellent system responsiveness:

- Complex relationship queries including 10 people with full relationship data complete in 204ms, demonstrating efficient indexing and query optimization
- Core genealogical operations (parents, children, siblings lookup) execute in 156ms, enabling real-time tree navigation and relationship discovery
- Profile card generation averages 223ms per image
- Family tree visualization (3 generations) averages 334ms per image
- Complex tree structures maintain sub-second generation times even with multiple generations
- The system efficiently handles 80+ timeline events with optimized serialization and responsive loading

Efficient component rendering utilizes React 19's concurrent features and `useMemo` hooks for expensive calculations, particularly in family tree data processing. The family tree visualization utilizes ReactFlow's built-in viewport rendering and virtualization to ensure consistent performance regardless of tree size. Initial page loads benefit from Vite's optimized build process with automatic code splitting and fingerprinted assets for long-term caching.

Animation performance utilizes CSS transforms and GPU acceleration for smooth transitions. The family tree rendering engine implements efficient diff algorithms through ReactFlow's internal optimization to minimize DOM updates during tree modifications. Virtualization techniques ensure consistent performance regardless of family tree size, with only visible nodes rendering in detail while off-screen nodes remain as lightweight placeholders.

The API design includes efficient data serialization through Active Model Serializers and comprehensive error handling. Image optimization occurs through Active Storage's built-in processing capabilities with Ruby VIPS for server-side image generation and optimization. The system automatically handles image resizing and format optimization for web delivery, reducing bandwidth usage and improving load times across all device types.

Form interactions provide immediate feedback through React Hook Form's optimized validation and submission handling. The application implements comprehensive error recovery mechanisms with user-friendly error messages and automatic retry logic where appropriate. Background job processing ensures resource-intensive operations don't block the user interface, with generation time tracking enabling performance monitoring and optimization.

### 4.7 Recent Enhancements

Recent development efforts have addressed critical functionality issues and enhanced overall system reliability. Key fixes include resolving the ex-spouse relationship bug where changing relationship status from divorced back to married didn't properly restore deceased status validation. The family tree display system was enhanced to prevent node overlap in 4+ generation trees through dynamic spacing algorithms, ensuring professional presentation quality in generated share images.

Alert system centralization replaced all standard JavaScript alerts with a unified SweetAlert2 implementation, providing consistent user experience across 100+ interaction points.

All user-facing messages utilize respectful, student-appropriate language suitable for educational environments. Debug console output was separated from user-facing messages, maintaining development functionality while ensuring clean user experience.

Marriage validation logic received significant improvements to prevent impossible relationship configurations. The system now validates temporal consistency across all relationship types, preventing scenarios where deceased individuals maintain active marriages. Enhanced service classes including BloodRelationshipDetector and UnifiedRelationshipCalculator handle complex genealogical scenarios with over 20 relationship types.

Mobile responsiveness improvements ensure optimal experiences across device sizes, with touch-friendly controls implementing minimum 44x44 pixel tap targets. The interface adapts appropriately to available screen space while maintaining full functionality on both desktop and mobile platforms.

The implementation utilizes Rails 8.0.2 with a hybrid approach for background processing: development environments disabled Redis dependencies for simplified setup, while maintaining production-ready Solid Queue configuration. This approach eliminates development complexity while preserving scalability for production deployment.

Performance enhancements include optimized database queries achieving sub-200ms response times for complex relationship calculations, and image generation averaging 334ms for 3-generation family trees. The system efficiently handles current data volumes of 18+ family members with 54+ relationships and 80+ timeline events.

### 4.8 Compliance

The application implements comprehensive security measures meeting modern web application standards. JWT-based authentication provides stateless session management with 42 active denylist entries ensuring secure token revocation. User-scoped data access prevents unauthorized access to family information, with strict isolation between different users' genealogical records.

Rack::Attack rate limiting protects against brute force attacks and API abuse, with customized throttling strategies for different endpoint types. The system enforces password strength requirements, secure session management, and implements CSRF protection through Rails built-in mechanisms.

Comprehensive audit trails are maintained through PaperTrail integration, with 144+ audit records tracking all data modifications including user attribution, timestamps, and change details. This ensures complete traceability for genealogical research verification and compliance requirements.

All user activities are logged with detailed metadata including IP addresses, user agents, and request IDs for security monitoring and debugging purposes. The audit system supports future compliance reporting and administrative oversight capabilities.

The system implements strict data protection principles with user-scoped access ensuring complete privacy between family trees. Authentication systems prevent cross-user data access, and all family information remains private to the owning user account. 

File uploads through Active Storage include security controls preventing directory traversal attacks and malicious file execution. Media files are stored with unique identifiers and served through secure URL generation with built-in access controls.

The interface implements ARIA labeling for screen readers and assistive technologies. Keyboard navigation support enables full application functionality without mouse interaction. Focus management ensures logical tab order and visible focus indicators throughout the interface.

SweetAlert2 modal implementation includes accessibility enhancements preventing focus issues with aria-hidden attributes. The responsive design provides optimal experiences across device types with touch-friendly controls implementing minimum 44x44 pixel tap targets.

The system handles family information with cultural sensitivity and respect for privacy. Relationship classifications accommodate diverse family structures including step-relationships, adoptions, and complex family arrangements. Timeline validation ensures chronological accuracy while preventing impossible family configurations.

All user-facing messaging maintains professional, respectful language appropriate for academic and educational environments. The system avoids assumptions about family structures while providing flexible relationship modeling suitable for diverse genealogical research needs.
