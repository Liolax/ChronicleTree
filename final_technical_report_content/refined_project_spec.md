## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. Purpose of The Product Design Specification Document

The Product Design Specification document describes the system architecture and overall system design of the ChronicleTree genealogy management web application. This document serves as the authoritative technical guide for the development team, project manager, and stakeholders throughout the project lifecycle. It captures the architectural decisions, design patterns, and implementation strategies that form the foundation of this modern family tree visualization platform.

The document provides comprehensive guidance on system construction, integration patterns, and user interface design principles. Certain sections, particularly those related to user interface design and user experience workflows, may be shared with clients and stakeholders to gather feedback and ensure alignment with user expectations.

## 2. General Overview and Design Guidelines/Approach

ChronicleTree is built on a modern full-stack architecture, featuring a React frontend and a Ruby on Rails API backend. The system is designed to provide accurate relationship modeling, intuitive data visualization, and comprehensive management of family information. The application addresses the limitations of traditional genealogy software through innovative design patterns and robust technical architecture that prioritizes both user experience and data integrity.

### 2.1. Assumptions/Constraints/Standards

The development environment assumes compatibility with modern web browsers supporting ES6+ JavaScript. The frontend requires Node.js (v18+) and the backend relies on Ruby (v3.0+) with Rails (v7+). The production environment is designed for a PostgreSQL database with Active Storage for file management. These technical requirements ensure access to modern development features while maintaining broad compatibility with current deployment platforms.

The business logic adheres to established genealogical principles, where family relationships maintain biological and legal precedence. For instance, step-relationships are formed exclusively through marriage to a biological family member, and relationships involving deceased spouses are temporally validated for accuracy. To balance user experience and system performance, media uploads are constrained to a 10MB file size limit.

Architecturally, the system follows RESTful API design principles, using JSON for all data exchange. Security is centered on JWT authentication for API access control, and responsive design principles ensure a seamless experience on mobile devices. The application maintains WCAG 2.1 compliance for accessibility, ensuring that genealogical research remains accessible to users with diverse abilities.

## 3. Architecture Design

### 3.1 Logical View

ChronicleTree employs a client-server architecture with a clear separation of concerns between the frontend and backend. This structure ensures modularity and scalability while supporting independent development and deployment of system components. The client-side, built with React, handles all user interface elements, including the family tree visualization, relationship management, and media galleries. It communicates with the backend via HTTP/HTTPS requests following RESTful conventions. The server-side, implemented as a Rails API, manages authentication, business logic, data modeling, and file storage, interacting with a PostgreSQL database to persist user data. This architectural relationship is visually detailed in the System Architecture Overview (Fig. 3.1.1).

**Figure 3.1.1: System Architecture Overview**  
*[Insert screenshot from ARCHITECTURE_DIAGRAMS.html → "System Architecture Overview" section here]*

### 3.2 Hardware Architecture

The ChronicleTree application is designed for a distributed hardware environment, supporting both local development and cloud-based production deployments. This flexible architecture enables cost-effective development while providing a clear migration path to enterprise-scale deployments.

For development, a standard desktop or laptop with at least 8GB of RAM, a dual-core processor, and SSD storage is sufficient. In production, the architecture supports both traditional servers and containerized environments. The Rails API backend runs efficiently on a standard Linux server with a minimum of 4GB of RAM and a multi-core processor. The PostgreSQL database requires adequate storage with backup capabilities, preferably on SSDs for optimal query performance.

Cloud deployments can leverage containerization for horizontal scaling, with a load balancer distributing requests and database clustering for redundancy. A Content Delivery Network (CDN) can enhance media file delivery, improving user experience through geographically distributed caching. The progression from a development setup to a full production environment is illustrated in the Deployment Architecture diagram (Fig. 3.2.1).

**Figure 3.2.1: Deployment Architecture Diagram**  
*[Insert screenshot from ARCHITECTURE_DIAGRAMS.html → "Deployment Architecture" section here]*

### 3.3 Software Architecture

The frontend architecture is centered on React 18, using modern hooks for state management and concurrent features for optimal performance. The interactive family tree is powered by React Flow (xyflow), providing professional-grade rendering and navigation capabilities. Styling is handled by Tailwind CSS for a consistent, utility-first design approach. Client-side routing is managed by React Router, and API communication is handled by Axios with interceptors for authentication and error handling.

The backend is built on Ruby on Rails 7, following the MVC pattern with API-only configuration. Active Storage manages file attachments with cloud compatibility, supporting both local disk storage in development and cloud providers in production. User authentication is handled by Devise with JWT token support, and Active Model Serializers format JSON responses for consistent API output. Background jobs, such as media processing and thumbnail generation, are managed by Sidekiq to avoid impacting user experience. A comprehensive summary of the technologies used can be found in the Technology Stack diagram (Fig. 3.3.1).

**Figure 3.3.1: Technology Stack Diagram**  
*[Insert screenshot from ARCHITECTURE_DIAGRAMS.html → "Technology Stack" section here]*

The frontend is organized into a hierarchical component structure following atomic design principles. The Tree directory contains visualization components like FamilyTreeFlow.jsx and CustomNode.jsx, implementing the core family tree rendering logic. Profile management components, such as RelationshipManager.jsx and MediaForm.jsx, are organized in dedicated directories by feature. Core logic is handled by utility modules like improvedRelationshipCalculator.js and familyTreeHierarchicalLayout.js, which implement the genealogical algorithms and tree positioning logic.

The backend follows Rails conventions with versioned API controllers under the api/v1 namespace. The controllers directory contains endpoints for managing people, relationships, and media with comprehensive error handling. Data models encapsulate business logic including validation rules and relationship constraints, while serializers ensure consistent JSON formatting across all API responses.

### 3.4 Security Architecture

Security is implemented through multiple layers, beginning with JWT-based authentication for stateless session management. Each API request includes a signed token containing user identification and expiration data, validated on every call to ensure authorized access. The token rotation strategy includes refresh tokens for extended sessions while maintaining security through short-lived access tokens.

Input validation occurs at multiple levels throughout the application stack. Client-side validation provides immediate user feedback using React Hook Form with Yup schemas, while server-side validation ensures data integrity through Rails model validations and custom validators. The Rails Strong Parameters feature prevents mass assignment vulnerabilities by explicitly defining permitted attributes for each endpoint.

File upload security includes comprehensive validation of file types, sizes, and content. The system implements virus scanning in production environments using ClamAV integration. User-uploaded content is stored separately from application files with unique identifiers, preventing directory traversal attacks. All uploaded files are served through Active Storage's secure URL generation with time-limited access tokens.

Database security includes encrypted connections using SSL/TLS, parameterized queries through Active Record to prevent SQL injection, and row-level security policies ensuring users can only access their own family data. Regular security audits using tools like Brakeman and dependency updates through Dependabot maintain protection against emerging vulnerabilities.

### 3.5 Communication Architecture

The API design follows RESTful principles with consistent URL patterns and appropriate HTTP verb usage. All endpoints return JSON responses with standardized error formats, enabling predictable client-side error handling. The API versioning strategy uses URL prefixes (/api/v1/), allowing backward compatibility as the API evolves while supporting gradual client migration.

Request/response cycles include comprehensive logging for debugging and audit purposes. Each request is assigned a unique identifier for tracing through the system. Rate limiting is implemented using Rack::Attack, preventing abuse while ensuring fair resource allocation among users. Custom rate limits apply to resource-intensive operations like file uploads and tree exports.

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policies enable secure cross-origin requests while preventing unauthorized domain access. The configuration supports both development environments with permissive policies and production environments with strict origin validation. Preflight request handling ensures smooth operation of complex API calls.

WebSocket support through Action Cable enables real-time features for future collaborative editing scenarios. The implementation includes automatic reconnection logic and fallback to polling for environments that don't support persistent connections. This hybrid approach ensures functionality across diverse network configurations while preparing for advanced real-time features.

The comprehensive API structure is documented in the API Endpoints Structure diagram (Fig. 3.5.1).

**Figure 3.5.1: API Endpoints Structure**  
*[Insert screenshot from ARCHITECTURE_DIAGRAMS.html → "API Endpoints Structure" section here]*

### 3.6 Performance

Performance optimization occurs at multiple levels throughout the application stack. Database queries utilize eager loading through Active Record's includes method to prevent N+1 query problems. Strategic indexes on frequently queried columns like user_id, person_id, and relationship_type ensure efficient data retrieval. Complex relationship calculations employ memoization to avoid redundant processing, with results cached for the duration of the request.

Frontend performance leverages React 18's concurrent features including automatic batching and transitions for smooth user interactions. The family tree visualization implements viewport-based rendering through React Flow's built-in virtualization, ensuring consistent performance regardless of tree size. Component lazy loading using React.lazy and Suspense boundaries defers initialization until needed, reducing initial page load times.

Caching strategies operate at multiple levels to minimize redundant processing. Browser caching for static assets uses fingerprinted filenames with far-future expiration headers. CDN distribution through services like CloudFront provides global edge caching for static resources. Server-side caching using Redis stores expensive computations like relationship calculations and tree layouts. Database query caching through Rails' built-in mechanisms reduces repeated database hits.

Background job processing through Sidekiq handles resource-intensive operations asynchronously. This includes image processing with multiple thumbnail sizes, email notifications for sharing invitations, and family tree export generation in various formats. Job prioritization ensures time-sensitive operations like authentication emails process quickly while bulk operations like exports queue appropriately. The performance monitoring infrastructure tracks job execution times and queue depths to identify bottlenecks.

## 4. System Design

### 4.1 Use Cases

The primary user workflow guides individuals through comprehensive family history documentation. Beginning with user registration, the system provides an intuitive path through family member creation, relationship definition, and rich profile development. Each interaction builds upon previous actions, creating a natural progression from simple family structures to complex multi-generational trees.

Key use cases encompass the full genealogical research lifecycle. Users create family trees by progressively adding members and defining their interconnections. The relationship management system supports complex scenarios including multiple marriages, step-families, and adopted children. Rich profile capabilities enable detailed biographical documentation including timeline events, media galleries, and custom facts. The sharing workflow allows users to generate public links for their family trees, enabling collaboration with relatives or sharing discoveries with genealogical communities.

The complete user journey from registration through tree sharing is visualized in the User Workflow diagram (Fig. 4.1.1).

*[Insert screenshot from ARCHITECTURE_DIAGRAMS.html → "User Workflow" section here]*

### 4.2 Database Design

The database schema balances normalization with query performance, utilizing PostgreSQL's advanced features for data integrity and efficiency. The core entity model centers on the people table, with relationships defined through a separate relationships table enabling bidirectional connections. This design supports complex family structures while maintaining referential integrity.

The people table stores essential biographical information including names, dates, and gender, with soft deletion through deleted_at timestamps preserving data integrity while supporting user-requested deletions. The facts table enables extensible profile information without schema modifications, supporting diverse cultural and historical documentation needs. The timeline_events table captures significant life moments with temporal and geographic context.

Relationship modeling utilizes a join table approach with relationship_type enumeration and additional metadata fields. This design supports complex scenarios including multiple marriages with date ranges, parent-child relationships with adoption flags, and calculated sibling relationships based on shared parentage. The bidirectional nature of relationships is handled through careful constraint design ensuring data consistency.

Media storage leverages Active Storage's polymorphic associations through the media table, enabling file attachments to multiple entity types. This flexibility supports profile photos, document scans, and multimedia content while maintaining consistent access patterns. The complete database structure is illustrated in the Database Schema Design diagram (Fig. 4.2.1).

Date normalization handles formats including MM/DD/YYYY, DD/MM/YYYY, and ISO 8601, with automatic detection based on user locale settings.

Name handling algorithms respect cultural naming conventions while providing consistent search and display functionality. The system supports multiple name formats including Western (given name, surname), Eastern (surname, given name), and Spanish (given names, paternal surname, maternal surname) conventions. Unicode support ensures proper representation of names from all writing systems, with transliteration options for cross-cultural research.

Media file processing includes automatic format conversion for web optimization. Large images undergo resolution reduction while maintaining visual quality through intelligent resampling. Unsupported formats receive conversion to standard web formats (JPEG, PNG, WebP) based on content analysis. Metadata extraction preserves original creation dates, camera information, and location data when available, enriching the historical record.

Import/export functionality transforms between ChronicleTree's internal format and standard genealogical data exchange formats. GEDCOM compatibility ensures integration with traditional genealogy software, while JSON export provides modern data portability. The conversion process handles encoding differences, date format variations, and relationship type mappings to maintain data fidelity across systems.

### 4.4 Application Program Interfaces

The relationship calculator API represents the core innovation of ChronicleTree, implementing complex genealogical logic through elegant abstractions. The calculateRelationshipToRoot() function traverses family connections to determine precise relationships between any two individuals, supporting over 20 relationship types with gender-specific terminology. The algorithm handles edge cases including multiple paths between individuals, choosing the most direct biological relationship when alternatives exist.

The API design emphasizes clarity and consistency across all endpoints. Each endpoint follows predictable patterns with comprehensive documentation generated through API blueprints. Request validation ensures data integrity while providing helpful error messages for client-side handling. Response formats include relationship metadata enabling rich user interface interactions, such as highlighting connection paths in the tree visualization.

Media management APIs provide secure file handling with automatic optimization. Upload endpoints accept multiple file formats while enforcing size limits and type restrictions. The system generates multiple image sizes for responsive display while preserving original files for download. Metadata APIs enable rich media organization with titles, descriptions, and date information, supporting comprehensive family archives.
