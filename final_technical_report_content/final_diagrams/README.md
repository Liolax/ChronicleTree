## Updates Made from Original Diagrams

1. **Real Data**: Replaced generic examples with actual system statistics
2. **Performance Metrics**: Added measured response times and processing speeds
3. **Security Details**: Included actual JWT denylist counts and rate limiting rules
4. **Component Specificity**: Named actual services, algorithms, and database tables
5. **Academic Formatting**: Enhanced for university technical report standards

These diagrams provide comprehensive technical documentation suitable for academic evaluation while accurately representing the ChronicleTree system architecture and implementation.
