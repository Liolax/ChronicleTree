# ChronicleTree: ### Slide 3: Technical Highli### Slide 5: Achievements & Q&A (60 sec)
"In summary: ChronicleTree exceeds all 6 core requirements — 100% fulfillment with advanced features.  
It has 100+ test files with comprehensive coverage, CI/CD ready, and built for production.  
The architecture demonstrates modern full-stack best practices with React 19, Rails 8.0.2, and hybrid background processing.  
What's next? Advanced search functionality across family trees, real-time collaboration, native mobile apps, AI-powered relationship suggestions, and GEDCOM import/export.  
The search feature will let users find relationship paths between any family members, search by date ranges, and get smart suggestions — building on our foundation of 20+ relationship types.  
I'd love to hear your questions or thoughts — thank you!"(60 sec)
"Let's talk tech.  
The frontend is a React 19 SPA using ReactFlow (@xyflow/react v12.8.2) for professional tree visualization.  
The backend is Rails 8.0.2 with Ruby 3.3.7, serving a secure API with JWT authentication.  
We use a hybrid approach: Sidekiq with Redis for development debugging, and Rails 8's Solid Queue for production simplicity.  
All data is stored in PostgreSQL, supporting complex relationships, facts, media, and more.  
What's innovative?  
ChronicleTree supports 20+ genealogical relationship types — blood, step, half, in-law, ex — enforces temporal validation (no impossible chronological connections), and uses gender-specific relationship terms.  
It's mobile-first with Tailwind CSS, accessible (WCAG 2.1), and secure by design." Live Presentation

### Slide 1: Title & Elevator Pitch (30 sec)
"Hello, I’m Yuliia, and I’m excited to present ChronicleTree — a modern, web-based family tree platform.  
It lets anyone create, manage, and visualize their family’s history — with advanced relationship logic and an intuitive, interactive user experience."

---

### Slide 2: The Challenge & Our Solution (40 sec)
"Why did I build ChronicleTree?  
Most genealogy tools are outdated, hard to use, and can’t model real-world family complexity.  
ChronicleTree fixes this, offering a modern interface, powerful relationship modeling — 20+ relationship types, with built-in validation — and a beautiful, interactive tree view."

### Slide 3: Technical Highlights (60 sec)
"Let’s talk tech.  
The frontend is a React 18 SPA (Single Page App) using React Flow for interactive tree visualization.  
The backend is Rails 7, serving a secure API, with JWT-based (JSON Web Token) authentication.  
All data is stored in PostgreSQL, supporting complex relationships, facts, media, and more.  
What’s innovative?  
ChronicleTree supports 20+ genealogical relationship types — blood, step, in-law, ex—enforces temporal validation (so you can’t create impossible connections), and uses gender-specific relationship terms.  
It’s mobile-ready, accessible, and secure by design."

### Slide 4: Live Demo (90 sec)
"Let’s see ChronicleTree in action.  
I’ll start by logging in, then add a new person and define their relationship — say, a parent or sibling.  
Notice as I add more people, the family tree expands, and I can drag, zoom, and center the view.  
Each person’s profile is rich — timeline events, photos, notes.  
And if I attempt to add an impossible relationship — like a child older than their parent — the system blocks it.  
(If the live demo hiccups, here are screenshots of the main features)."

### Slide 5: Achievements & Q&A (60 sec)
"In summary: ChronicleTree meets and exceeds all core requirements — feature - rich, robust, and secure.  
It’s 90%+ tested, CI/CD ready, and built for real-world use.  
What’s next? I’m working on collaboration, mobile apps, and AI-powered suggestions.  
I’d love to hear your questions or thoughts — thank you!"
