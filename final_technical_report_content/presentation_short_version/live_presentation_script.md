# ChronicleTree: 5-Minute Live Presentation

---

### Slide 1: Title & Elevator Pitch (30 sec)
"Hello, I’m Yuliia, and I’m excited to present ChronicleTree — a modern, web-based family tree platform.  
It lets anyone create, manage, and visualize their family’s history — with advanced relationship logic and an intuitive, interactive user experience."

---

### Slide 2: The Challenge & Our Solution (40 sec)
"Why did I build ChronicleTree?  
Most genealogy tools are outdated, hard to use, and can’t model real-world family complexity.  
ChronicleTree fixes this, offering a modern interface, powerful relationship modeling — 20+ relationship types, with built-in validation — and a beautiful, interactive tree view."

---

### Slide 3: Technical Highlights (60 sec)
"Let’s talk tech.  
The frontend is a React 18 SPA (Single Page App) using React Flow for interactive tree visualization.  
The backend is Rails 7, serving a secure API, with JWT-based (JSON Web Token) authentication.  
All data is stored in PostgreSQL, supporting complex relationships, facts, media, and more.  
What’s innovative?  
ChronicleTree supports 20+ genealogical relationship types — blood, step, in-law, ex—enforces temporal validation (so you can’t create impossible connections), and uses gender-specific relationship terms.  
It’s mobile-ready, accessible, and secure by design."

---

### Slide 4: Live Demo (90 sec)
"Let’s see ChronicleTree in action.  
I’ll start by logging in, then add a new person and define their relationship — say, a parent or sibling.  
Notice as I add more people, the family tree expands, and I can drag, zoom, and center the view.  
Each person’s profile is rich — timeline events, photos, notes.  
And if I attempt to add an impossible relationship — like a child older than their parent — the system blocks it.  
(If the live demo hiccups, here are screenshots of the main features)."

---

### Slide 5: Achievements & Q&A (60 sec)
"In summary: ChronicleTree meets and exceeds all core requirements — feature - rich, robust, and secure.  
It’s 90%+ tested, CI/CD ready, and built for real-world use.  
What’s next? I’m working on collaboration, mobile apps, and AI-powered suggestions.  
I’d love to hear your questions or thoughts — thank you!"

> **Time Management:**
> - Move briskly through slides 1–3 (~2.5 minutes total), then demo (~1.5 min), and leave ~1 minute for wrap-up and Q&A.
> - If time is tight, shorten the demo or skip less-critical details.
