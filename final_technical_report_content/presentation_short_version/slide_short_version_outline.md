## üé§ SPEAKER NOTES FOR SEARCH FEATURE

### When mentioning future search functionality:
_"Looking ahead, we're planning advanced search capabilities - imagine being able to search across your entire family tree by relationships, date ranges, or life events. Users could find connection paths between any two relatives, or get smart suggestions for missing family links. This builds on our solid foundation of 20+ relationship types and temporal validation."_

### Technical context for search:
- **Database optimization:** Leveraging PostgreSQL's full-text search
- **Graph algorithms:** Relationship path finding using breadth-first search
- **Caching strategy:** Search results cached using our hybrid approach
- **Real-time updates:** Search index maintained as family data changes

---

## üí° DELIVERY TIPS FOR COMPACT VERSION

### Timing Management:
- Keep transitions crisp between slides
- If Q&A is required, leave 30-45 seconds at end
- For demo steps: narrate actions, highlight unique features
- Prepare static screenshots as backup for live demo

### Visual Strategy:
- Use embedded diagrams to maintain flow
- Point to visuals while speaking but don't read them
- Screenshots should complement, not replace, live demo
- Keep embedded visuals simple and readable

### Key Messages to Emphasize:
1. **Modern Technology Stack:** React 19, Rails 8.0.2, hybrid processing
2. **Production Ready:** 100+ tests, comprehensive coverage
3. **User-Focused:** Intuitive interface, temporal validation
4. **Future Vision:** Search, collaboration, AI features
