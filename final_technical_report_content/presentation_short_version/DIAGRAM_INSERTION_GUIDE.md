**Speaking notes:** "Secure API design with JWT authentication and comprehensive validation"
```

## üîß Embedded Diagrams for Existing Slides

### In Slide 2 (Problem/Solution) - ADD WORKFLOW COMPARISON:
```
**Insert:** diagrams/user_workflow_eraser.md (as small preview)
**Position:** Bottom right corner
**Purpose:** Show intuitive user flow vs complex traditional genealogy software
```

### In Slide 4 (Demo) - ADD SCREENSHOTS:
```
**Insert:** UI mockups from good_mock-ups/ folder
**Files to use:**
- chronicle_main_family_tree.html (tree visualization)
- chronicle_individual_profile.html (rich profiles)
**Position:** Right side of slide alongside demo steps
```

### In Slide 5 (Achievements) - ADD METRICS VISUAL:
```
**Insert:** Create simple metrics chart showing:
- 6/6 Requirements Exceeded ‚úÖ
- 100+ Test Files üß™
- React 19 + Rails 8.0.2 üöÄ
- 20+ Relationship Types üë•
**Position:** Center background or side panel
```

## üé® Diagram Conversion Instructions

### For Markdown Diagrams (.md files):
1. Copy the mermaid/plantuml code
2. Use mermaid.live or similar tool to generate PNG/SVG
3. Insert as image in HTML slides

### For HTML Diagrams (.html files):
1. Screenshot the rendered diagram
2. Or embed as iframe if presenting in browser
3. Ensure high resolution for projection

### Styling Tips:
- Use consistent color scheme (indigo/blue theme matching slides)
- Ensure text is readable at presentation size
- Add slide numbers and navigation

## üéØ Timing Adjustments

**Original 5-minute structure:**
- Slide 1: 30s
- Slide 2: 40s  
- Slide 3: 60s
- Slide 4: 90s
- Slide 5: 60s

**With diagram slides (7-8 minutes):**
- Slide 1: 30s
- Slide 2: 40s
- Slide 3: 45s
- Slide 3A-3C: 90s total (30s each)
- Slide 4: 75s
- Slide 4A-4B: 60s total (30s each)  
- Slide 5: 60s

**Alternative fast version (keep 5 minutes):**
- Embed diagrams within existing slides instead of separate slides
- Use diagrams as visual backgrounds or side panels
- Focus on 2-3 key architectural diagrams only

## üìù Speaker Notes for Diagram Slides

### Slide 3A (Architecture):
"Our architecture follows modern three-tier patterns. React 19 handles the interactive frontend, Rails 8.0.2 provides the secure API layer, and PostgreSQL manages complex family data relationships."

### Slide 3B (Tech Stack):
"We implement a hybrid approach - Sidekiq with Redis for development debugging, Solid Queue for production simplicity. This demonstrates real-world architectural decision-making."

### Slide 3C (Database):
"The data model handles complex family relationships with temporal validation - preventing impossible chronological connections while supporting 20+ relationship types."

### Slide 4A (Relationships):
"Here's what makes ChronicleTree powerful - comprehensive relationship modeling including blood relations, step-families, half-siblings, in-laws, and even ex-relationships with proper temporal handling."

### Slide 4B (API):
"The API design prioritizes security with JWT authentication, RESTful conventions, and comprehensive validation - production-ready architecture for sensitive family data."
