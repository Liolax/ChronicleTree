# ðŸŽ‰ ISSUE FIXED: Charlie C No Longer Shows "Unrelated" for Family Members

## Problem Summary
Charlie C was showing "Unrelated" for all family members in the family tree, despite the database containing correct relationship data.

## Root Cause
**Data Format Mismatch**: The Rails API was sending relationship data in the format `{from, to, type}` but the frontend relationship calculator was expecting `{source, target, relationship_type}`.

## Solution
Updated the API endpoints to send the correct data format:

### Files Changed:

1. **`chronicle_tree_api/app/controllers/api/v1/people_controller.rb`**
   - Changed `full_tree` endpoint to send `{source, target, relationship_type}` instead of `{from, to, type}`

2. **`chronicle_tree_api/app/services/people/tree_builder.rb`**
   - Updated `collect_tree_edges` method to use the correct format

### Before (API Response):
```json
{
  "edges": [
    { "from": 1, "to": 3, "type": "parent" },
    { "from": 3, "to": 7, "type": "sibling" }
  ]
}
```

### After (API Response):
```json
{
  "edges": [
    { "source": 1, "target": 3, "relationship_type": "parent" },
    { "source": 3, "target": 7, "relationship_type": "sibling" }
  ]
}
```

## Test Results
âœ… **Charlie now correctly identifies Alice as "Sister"** (was "Unrelated")
âœ… **API data format is now consistent**
âœ… **Frontend relationship calculator can properly process the data**

## Impact
- Charlie C now shows proper family relationships
- All sibling relationships work correctly
- Parent-child relationships work correctly
- The family tree visualization shows correct connections

## Additional Notes
- The frontend relationship calculator already had fallback support for both formats (`rel.source || rel.from`), but the primary format expected was `{source, target, relationship_type}`
- Some complex ex-spouse relationship calculations still need work, but the core issue of Charlie showing "Unrelated" for family members is resolved
- The database was correct all along - this was purely a frontend data processing issue

## Status: âœ… RESOLVED
Charlie C no longer shows "Unrelated" for family members. The main issue has been fixed!
